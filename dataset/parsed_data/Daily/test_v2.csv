89,"Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.",0
90,Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.,0
91,"I can't really deal with any distractions right now, but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together.",0
92,"Hi there, I want to reserve a hotel room.",0
93,"No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please?",0

113,"I'll just go and check it for you, sir.",0
114,"Good evening, madam. Can I help you?",0
115,Yes. I bought this sheet here yesterday.,0

127,I like the sound of that.,4
128,"Yes, that is today's sale price.",0
129,A dozen will be fine.,0
130,Is there anything else you'd like to get?,0
131,"No, thank you.",4
132,These roses should make your wife very happy.,4
133,Why'd you pull me over?,0
134,Are you aware that you drove through a red light?,0
135,I ran a red light?,6

148,"I try my best to eat only fruits, vegetables, and chicken.",0
149,Is that really all that you eat?,0
150,That's basically it.,0
151,How do you stick to only those foods?,0
152,"Actually, fruits and veggies are really good for you.",0
153,"Yeah, I know, but what about the chicken?",0
154,"I mainly eat baked chicken, because there's not a lot of fat.",0
155,That does sound pretty good.,4
156,"I know it does, and that's because it is.",0
157,Good afternoon! Can I help you?,0
158,Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located? I want to buy a silk coat.,0
159,"This way, please. Here they are. They're all handmade.",0
160,"Oh, they look nice. May I try that black one on?",4
161,Of course. The fitting room is right over there.,0
162,Do you have a medium in the same color? This one is a little tight.,0
163,l'm sorry. All the black of that size are sold out. Would you like a red one?,0
164,OK. Let me try it on. What do you think?,0
165,"Oh, that suits you very well. Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck.",0
166,Really? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow. Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in?,0

178,Is this Friday okay?,0
179,Is 6 o’ clock Friday evening okay?,0
180,"Yes, I will schedule you for that time.",0
181,Thank you very much. See you then.,4
182,"Next, please. Hello, may I help you, sir?",0
183,"Yes, I want to send a registered airmail letter to France.",0
184,"Ok, it comes four dollars twenty cents.",0
185,Here is five dollars.,0
186,Here is your change. Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail.,0
187,I also want to pack up my package. This is the notes.,0
188,Let me see. En.. just a minute. Here it is. I need your signature on this note.,0

190,Drop it in the mail box mark out of town. at that corner.,0
191,Thank you very much.,4
192,You ‘ re welcome.,4

203,that sounds nice. Do you want to share some kebabs as well?,4
204,ok. How about some lamb kebabs?,0
205,that's my favourite. Do you want to have some wine or beer?,4
206,I think I'll have a beer.,0
207,"ok, shall I flag down the waitress?",0
208,I wouldn't recommend it. I think we should wait until she comes round.,0
209,you're right. That might seem a bit rude. It's a good thing I've got you with me!,4
210,what would you do without me?,0
211,pompous. How may I help you?,0
212,"Yes, I'd like to reserve a table for dinner.",0
213,How large a group are you expecting?,0
214,Six couples.,0

222,"Yes, sir. I acted as a secretary in an insurance company.",0
223,Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain?,0
224,"Well, to begin with, I would say she needs to be diligent, and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative. Finally, she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing, summary writing, keep minutes at meetings, and so on. Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average.",0
225,Have you had any experience with computer?,0
226,"Yes, I studied in a computer training program, and can process data through the computer.",0
227,That's fine. What about operating the fax and duplicator?,0
228,I can handle them without any trouble,0
229,What have you learned from jobs you have held?,0
230,"Above all, I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me. So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed.",0
231,Very good.,4
232,"Hi, Dan. What's new?",0
233,Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days.,0
234,I went to Salt Lake City on business. What's up?,0
235,I got fired.,5
236,"How come? Last time I saw you. You told me it was a good job, and you'd like to take it as a career. That was only one month ago. Why this sudden change?",6
237,"It's a long story. In a word, I didn't do a good job of it. I messed up a business deal, a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up.",5
238,What are you going to do now?,0
239,"I am trying to find a job asap. Lily doesn't know yet. I didn't tell her. I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office, and she thought I went to work as usual.",0
240,That's not the way to solve the problem. Did you look in the classified advertisements column?,0
241,"Yes, I did. But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in.",0
242,"Listen. I will see what I can do, ok? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now. She is your wife and I am sure she will understand.",0

249,Why did you do that?,0
250,I needed to get something really quick.,0
251,Where did you park at?,0
252,At my apartment building.,0
253,Don't you have your own parking spot?,0
254,I needed to be fast.,0
255,That was very lazy of you.,0
256,How may I help you?,0
257,I’ m having a problem.,0
258,What problem are you having?,0
259,There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn’ t make.,0
260,Do you have the statement for your card?,0
261,Here it is.,0
262,What are the charges you’ re referring to?,0
263,The last four charges on the page.,0
264,I’ m afraid we’ re going to have to investigate these charges.,0
265,How long will an investigation take?,0
266,"I honestly don’ t know, but we will freeze payment on these charges.",0
267,That sounds absolutely fantastic.,4
268,Good afternoon. Can I be of service?,0
269,I don't know. Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter?,0
270,"Yes, of course. We have Treasury Notes with two, three and five-year terms available.",0
271,"Two years is fine, with a value of 1,000 RIB.",0
272,"OK, could I take a look at some ID please, like a passport?",0
273,"Here you go. By the way, is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up?",0
274,"No, I'm afraid that isn't possible. You must wait until maturity before you cash them.",0
275,Hey. Why did you take that money? You are such a cheater! I should send you to jail!,1
276,"I am not cheating. When you pass go, you collect $ 200, Everyone knows that!",1
277,Well you can’ t just take the money. You have to ask the bank for money. And I’ m the banker.,1
278,Banker?,0
279,Yes...,0
280,Can I have my $ 200 please?,0
281,"Sure. Here you are, $ 200, Thank you, please come again! Now it’ s my turn to roll the dice.",4
282,"Hi, is this Professor Clark’ s office?",0
283,This is Professor Clark speaking.,0
284,"Hi, this is Kalina from your morning literature class.",0
285,"Yes, what can I do for you?",0
286,I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won’ t be able to come to school today.,5
287,My goodness! Are you OK?,6
288,"I broke my leg, but it is healing.",0
289,How long will you be out of class?,0
290,I should be able to return by next Monday.,0
291,"Fine. Well, thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent. I hope you feel better soon.",0
292,Good afternoon! Did you call for a plumber?,0
293,"Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I’ m so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there’ s water leaking everywhere!",0
294,"I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’ s why it won’ t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’ s not working either. I suspect that there’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage. That’ s what’ s making your toilet overflow.",0
295,"Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.",0
296,"Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely, that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’ t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’ s urgent.",0
297,That would be great! Is it expensive?,4
298,Let’ s see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.,0
299,"Listen, Karen, I need your help. I don't know anyone here yet.",0
300,I'm glad to help you. What's wrong?,4
301,My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight.,0
302,I'm sorry to hear it. What's wrong with her?,5
303,"Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her.",0
304,You need a babysitter.,0
305,"Yes, I'd ask Jill, the girl I've had before, but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights.",0
306,I could have Suzy stay at my place.,0
307,"I don't want to do that to you, Karen.",0
308,Why not?,0
309,Your own kids would get Suzy's cold. I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. But I don't know who to ask. I need someone more mature than Jill. It might even be for two or three days.,0
310,"I know who we can ask. There is a girl I know, Sara Ralston.She is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job. I know her from my church, and I trust her completely.",0
311,"I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice, I know. But Hank and I are leaving tonight.",0
312,I'll get you her number. I hope she can do it. She is very responsible.,0
313,I'm glad you know someone. I knew you would be the best person to ask about this. I don't want to insult Jill or her mother. I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older.,4
314,I'll go home and get Sara's number. I'll call her first myself.,0
315,Great. Then call me and let me know if she's free.,4
316,Good evening. What'll you have?,0
317,I'd like a beer. What kind of beer do you have?,0
318,Draft beer and cans beer. Which do you prefer?,0
319,A draft beer please.,0

323,"Hello, Mr. Black, how are you?",0
324,"Fine, thank you, and how are you?",0
325,"Very well, thank you. It's nice to meet you again. I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport, as I was busy yesterday. I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York.",4
326,"Yes, a very pleasant journey indeed. Thank you.",4
327,How are you getting along with your business?,0
328,"Not bad. The fur market is not very brisk lately, but the selling season is advancing near. I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year.",0
329,"I hope we can do more business together. Though we are satisfied with our past trade record, there are still possibilities for more business. In the meantime, let's discuss other spheres of cooperation, such as investment, technology transfer and technical assistance.",0
330,"excuse me, could you tell me which line I’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package?",0
331,"you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage.",0
332,that’ s a really long line. How long do you think it’ ll take to get through all those people?,0

334,can I buy stamps here?,0
335,sure. How many would you like?,0

342,and the bubble wrap?,0
343,that’ s another quid.,0
344,thanks a lot. You’ Ve been very helpful.,4
345,"Good evening, Saliva. What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen? What are you doing now?",4
346,I am cooking now!,0

349,It is a good idea. What dish are you cooking now?!,0
350,I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker. Have you ever tried steamed fish?,0
351,"Yes, I have. But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious. The fish is not well-done and too salty.",0
352,That's the case. I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much.,0
353,I have the same idea as yours.,0
354,It's OK. Please have a taste of it.,0
355,"Thank you. Oh, it's very delicious.",4

365,"Well, let me check for you. I am sorry, sir. They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry, is that right?",0
366,"Yes, I ordered the express service.",0
367,"Sir, we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later. Is that all right?",0
368,That's fine.,0
369,I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports.,0
370,It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight.,0
371,What about a draft at 120 days sight?,0
372,All right. But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us.,0
373,A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports. You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due.,0
374,Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank. You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible.,0
375,I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries.,0
376,So do I.,0
377,"There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?",0
378,I haven't seen her yet.,0
379,I think that she is very pretty.,0
380,Tell me how she looks.,0
381,She's kind of short.,0
382,What height is she?,0
383,She's probably about five feet.,0
384,"That's nice, but tell me what she looks like.",0
385,The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.,0
386,I think I might've bumped into her before.,0
387,Are you telling me that you've seen her before?,0
388,I believe so.,0
389,"Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then, sir?",0
390,"Yes, and I want to buy the insurance too. I think it's necessary.",0
391,"You're smart to buy it. At 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal.",4
392,Can I return the car in San Francisco?,0
393,"San Francisco? No, sir.We only have this office here. You will have to return it here.",0
394,Really? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities.,6
395,"No, sir. That's only with the very big companies. I'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot.",0
396,"Well, I guess I will have to drive back down then. Hmm. I didn't think of that.",0
397,"Do you still want the car, sir?",0
398,Yes. It will be fun. Driving back down the coast. My girlfriend will like it.,4
399,It's a beautiful drive.,4
400,Where are the keys?,0
401,"Just a moment, sir. We have to finish filling out the forms.",0
402,Look at the show on TV. I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant. I really want to eat at that restaurant. I am a seafood lover.,0
403,"Speaking of seafood, my mouth is watering. Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood.",0
404,Sound great. Let's go!,4
405,Look at the crystal clear fridge. You can see so many kinds of seafood in it. They all look very fresh and delicious.,0
406,True. I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head.,0
407,You sound like a seafood expert. I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps.,0
408,You are not too bad as well. I also want to have a steamed lobster. It is really taste like heaven.,0
409,Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food.,0
410,Wait. Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first.,0
411,OK. I will wait for you inside the restaurant,0
412,Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters?,0
413,Where do you want to go?,0
414,I'm going to the hospital.,0
415,Get in. I'll take you.,0
416,About how much will it cost?,0
417,It will cost you $ 10.,0
418,"By the way, what's the time?",0
419,"You can see the time on the meter. I have radio time, you know.",0
420,It's a quarter to 12. Could you please drive a little faster?,0
421,Certainly.,0
422,You're made a good choice. This china tea set is unusual.,0
423,Where was it from?,0
424,It was made in Jingdezhen.,0
425,Jingdezhen? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain '?,0
426,You are right.,0
427,This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.,4
428,It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China.,0
429,It must be most precious.,4
430,But it is really worth the price.,0
431,"Hello, Miao Li, Where are you going?",0
432,"Hello, I am going to the store to buy some fruit.",0
433,"Oh, Would you do me a favor?",0
434,Yes?,0
435,Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store.,0
436,Sure. Do you want it to be registered?,0
437,"Yes, I think so. There are some pictures in it. It would be a great pity if they were lost.",0
438,"Yes, I will be glad to mail your letter.",0
439,Thanks.,4
440,you are welcome.,4
441,"I have a cell phone in my car. Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me, and then I can call the police?",0
442,Alright.,0
443,It doesn't work. It looks like it's broken. I need to get to a hospital. You should drive me there.,3
444,"Oh, yeah? It's better if we make a police report first. Then you can go to the hospital.",0
445,Damn it! I'm injured here. We could wait all day for the police.,1
446,"Well, you'll just have to wait. I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. Don't worry. You'll get to the hospital in time.",0
447,It really hurts.,0
448,"Yes, maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. You know what I mean?",0
449,To hell with you. The accident was your fault.,1
450,"I'm afraid it wasn't. And when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. But enough of this bickering. I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone. Alright?",0
451,To hell with you.,1
452,"Good morning. Vane Theater, at your service.",0
453,Hello. I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl. What's on this weekend?,0
454,"Well, there will be charity performance on Saturday night. And also, there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night.",0
455,It's a good thing that I have choices here. Can you tell me about the one on Saturday?,0
456,Sure. It's to raise money for the homeless.,0
457,What about the performance itself?,0
458,"Oh, it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven.",0
459,"Wow, a story about the clever Monkey King. It's a classic and children's favorite.",0
460,It surely is. And the cast is really the best.,0
461,Wonderful! How much is the ticket?,4
462,"The price varies according to the seats. 300 for the front, 200 for the middle, and 50 for the back.",0
463,What dressing would you like on the salad?,0
464,"French dressing, please.",0
465,I beg your pardon?,0
466,"Oh, French dressing.",0
467,"Sorry, it's not available now.Anything else?",0
468,We still prefer French dressing.,0
469,Could I have some fish?,0
470,Certainly. And what vegetables would you like?,4
471,"Oh, spinach, I think.",0
472,"Fine, And what about something to drink?",0
473,"Just a beer, please.",0
474,Good. Thank you.sir.,4
475,Would you like to have some more beer?,0
476,"No, thanks. I ' Ve had enough. I'll have my bill, please.",4
477,Of course. Please wait a moment. I'll go and get it.,0
478,Thank you.,4
479,"Hi, George. I'm going to have a job interview next week. Could you give me some advice?",0
480,"Sure. First of all, it’ s very important for you not to be late. Job interviewers usually don’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time, only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic.",0
481,"Yeah, that's very important.",0
482,"So you’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time, look around to see what the employees are wearing. So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment.",0
483,I’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer.,0
484,"That’ s right. You need to create a good image in a limited time, usually about 30 to 45 minutes.",0
485,It’ s always easier to say something than to do it.,0
486,"It’ s not too difficult to make a good impression. For example, you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed. Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style. This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications.",0
487,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans.,0
488,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview. Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job, or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes.",0
489,It’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes.,0
490,"You misunderstood me. Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job, or that you are snobbish or frivolous.",0
491,I know what you mean. I ought to wear right clothes at the right time.,0
492,You got it. Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement.,0
493,It seems that ' clothes make the man '.,0
494,"It may not be true, but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior.",0
495,"Good day! Welcome to Lincoln Bank, how may we assist you?",0
496,Hello. I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived. I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates.,0
497,Thanks. Have you got the L / C number?,0
498,It's NX567822100007.,0
499,Hang on a tick and I'll check for you. I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving.,0
500,"OK, thanks for checking. Could you give me a ring when it arrives, please?",0
501,No problem. I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in.,0
502,"Hello, Sir. How can we help you today?",0
503,"I need to find out some more information for L / C. I would like an outline of responsibilities, both ours, yours and the beneficiary, please.",0
504,"OK, to start, the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms, Way Bills, Bills of Lading, Customs forms, various certificates.",0
505,"OK, got it. Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead?",0
506,"Just that in effect, a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank, the bank's customer, and the beneficiary, and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds.",0
507,"That sounds fine, thanks for that. Let's go ahead!",4
508,911 emergency. What is the problem?,0
509,I would like to report a break-in.,0
510,When was this break-in?,0
511,I believe it happened last night.,0
512,Where was the break-in?,0
513,It happened at my house.,0
514,Was anything stolen?,0
515,I haven't checked yet.,0
516,Why do you think there was a break-in?,0
517,My front window was broken.,0
518,We'll send a squad car shortly.,0
519,I'd appreciate that.,0
520,Excuse me. How much is the chocolate bar?,0
521,One dollar.,0
522,"So, I can have five for five dollars?",0
523,"Actually, you can only have four.",0
524,"Oh, yeah. I forgot tax. Give me four then, please.",0
525,Okay. Thanks.,0
526,House keeping.May I come in?,0
527,Come in please.,0
528,"Good evening, sir. I come to make the bed. Shall I do it now or later?",0
529,"Well, since you have come, do it now please?",0
530,That's all. Have a nice stay here.,0
531,Thank you.Please get some soap for us.,0
532,Just a moment. I will do it right now.,0
533,Excuse me. I have an appointment with Mr. Li at nine. May I come in?,0
534,"Yes, come in please. I am Mr. Li. You must be My Liu, right?",0
535,"Yes, I am My Liu. Thanks.",0
536,I'd like to start this interview with some questions. Why do you think you are qualified for this position?,0
537,"According to your advertisement, you want an experienced software engineer. I think my background meets the requirement of this position.",0
538,Then tell me something about your background.,0
539,"My major was computer science when I was at college, and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language.",0
540,"Well, what do you think about the development in computers?",0
541,"The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software. In some regions, the hardware is completely replaced by software. So I think the software industry has a great future.",0
542,Have you ever designed any programs concerning network?,0
543,"Yes, I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE.",0
544,Have you got anything to ask me?,0
545,"Yes, can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position?",0
546,"Yes, of course. You would be responsible for the development of software products.",0
547,I see. This is my advantage.,0
548,Good. Have you got any other questions?,0
549,No.,0
550,"Ok, I will contact you in a week. See you.",0
551,"Thank you, bye-bye.",0
552,"Tom, is Jenny crying?",0
553,Can you take he away from me?,2
554,I’ m just coming for that.,0
555,She kept bothering me.,0
556,She’ s your sister. What she asked was only duck soup for you. Why can’ t you be good to her?,0
557,"But I am her brother, not her servant.",0
558,"Hello, where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater?",0
559,Maybe you should look around for an outlet.,0
560,That is a wonderful idea.,4
561,Outlets have more reasonable prices.,0
562,Thank you for your help.,4
563,No problem. Good luck,4
564,Wow! Your fruit looks really fresh! How much are these apples?,4
565,The apples are 30NT each. How many would you like?,0
566,"Let's see, 30NT is about... almost a dollar US. What?! How about these pineapples?",0
567,"They're 250NT each, but they're not edible. They're only used for worship.",0
568,"Hmm, 250NT is... 8 dollars?!! And you can't even eat them? You're crazy!",6
569,Wait! Don't go just yet. These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch.,0
570,"Now that's more like it! Bananas have lots of potassium, too!",0
571,"They're also good for your digestion! Would you like some kiwis, too?",4
572,Are they from Taiwan?,0
573,They're imported from New Zealand. Four for 50NT. Nine for a hundred.,0
574,OK. I'll take four kiwis.,0
575,"Amelia, could you spare a few minutes?",0
576,sure. What do you need?,0
577,"well, I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice.",0
578,really? Why?,6
579,it's complicated. But basically it boils down to one thing. This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go.,0
580,but surely they won't fire you! You're one of the most experienced managers here!,6
581,"well, to be honest, there's another reason. I've got a better offer.",0
582,well that's great news! Congratulations! Where will you be located?,4
583,"the head office is in New York, but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time.",0
584,"it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity.",0
585,I have. I feel lucky. I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more.,0
586,"I'm sorry to bring this up, but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go?",0
587,"of course I can. In fact, if there are other job opportunities at this new company, I'll recommend you personally.",4
588,thanks. I appreciate that.,4
589,"Thanks for inviting me to work out with you, Joan.",4
590,"Don't mention it, let's go in.",0
591,"Yeah, this place looks great. Wow, look at her, she can certainly get down, can't she?",0
592,"She sure can. Are you jealous, Leslie?",0
593,"A little, I wish I could do that.",0
594,You can! With a little practice.,0
595,"Look at him, he's buff.",0
596,I think he's hot too.,0
597,How do they all get in such tiptop shape?,0
598,Exercised over and over. Exercise is a key.,0
599,That's it. I decided to turn over a new leaf. I'm going to exercise every single day.,0
600,"Good for you, Leslie!",4
601,Excuse me. Check please.,0
602,"OK, how was everything?",0
603,Very nice. Thank you.,4
604,Would you like this to-go?,0
605,"Yes, can you put it in a plastic bag?",0
606,"Sure, no problem. Here you are. That'll be 25 dollars.",0
607,Do you take credit cards?,0
608,"Yes, we accept Visa and MasterCard.",0
609,"OK, here you are.",0
610,Thanks. I'll be right back.,0
611,OK.,0
612,Here's your receipt.,0
613,Thank you.,4
614,You're welcome. Please come again.,4
615,"You look upset, anything wrong?",0
616,I'm going to quit the job.,0
617,Why?,0
618,The task is tough.,0
619,You'd look before you leap.,0
620,Thanks for your concern.,0
621,Excuse me. Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is?,0
622,"That's over on Callaway Street, isn't it?",0
623,"Yes, but I can't find Callaway Street.",0
624,Walk that way for about four blocks. The hotel's about two blocks north of there.,0
625,Thanks a lot.,4
626,Not at all.,4
627,"Professor Li, do you know where to buy art supplies?",0
628,For what? Are you taking up painting?,0
629,No. I can't paint. I'm asking for my niece. She is really into it.,0
630,"Oh, good. How old is your niece?",4
631,"She is eight. Actually, I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift.",0
632,It's a wise thing to do. Art will do a child a world of good.,0
633,Hello?,0
634,"Hi, Mr. Smith. This is Mary. Is Jenny there?",0
635,"No, I’ m afraid not, Mary. May I take a message for her?",0
636,"Yes, please tell her that band practice has been moved to Tuesday night at eight thirty.",0
637,O. K. No problem. Anything else?,0
638,"No, but if she has any questions, she can call me at 555-2345.",0
639,"All right, I’ ll leave her the message, Mary. Thanks for calling.",0
640,Thank you. Bye.,0
641,Goodbye.,0

652,Do you want me to show you where I found them?,0
653,I would like that. Thank you.,4
654,I need help with the office party.,0
655,"Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?",0
656,I have no idea what the entertainment should be.,0
657,Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering?,0
658,Let's make it a formal affair.,0
659,"Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food?",0
660,American food would be the best choice.,0
661,"That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music?",0
662,We should bring in a really good DJ.,0
663,That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday.,0
664,Only one. But I wanted to make sure I'd get it.,0
665,"Yeah, I really wanted that Chanel bag, too. But just in case you should bid low.",0
666,But there are only two more days until the bidding closes!,3
667,"I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute, and got it sixty percent off!",4
668,Oh... I'm such a newbie. But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket.,0
669,"Don't count on it, Babe. eBay is always full of surprises.",4
670,Well... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket?,0
671,Can you tell me where the pots and pans are?,0
672,Pots and pans are right over there.,0
673,"Oh, thank you.",4
674,Could I interest you in our store credit card?,0
675,"No, thanks. I already have credit cards.",0
676,But our credit card saves you 10 percent.,0
677,That's a nice discount.,4
678,Here. Let me give you an application form.,0
679,"Thank you, but I'm just browsing today.",4
680,Okay. Enjoy your browsing.,4
681,Here is the fish counter. Look at the lobsters and crabs. Shall we have some?,0
682,"I'm allergic to these things, you know.",0
683,"Sorry, I forgot. I don’ t like seafood, neither.",5
684,"Let’ s go over there and get some milk, a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice.",0
685,Let's get frozen juice. It is really good. We’ Ve got enough food. Let’ s go over to the check-out stand.,0
686,OK. But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by.,0
687,"Good morning, may I speak with Professor Clark, please?",0
688,You are speaking with Professor Clark.,0
689,"Professor, I am Kalina from your morning literature class.",0

691,I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school.,5
692,"Oh, my God! I hope you are all right.",6

694,How much school will you miss?,0
695,I only need to take this week off.,0
696,I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won’ t be in class. See you next week!,0
697,"Honey, I need to have a talk with you.",0
698,"Dad, I have to do my homework.",0
699,"No, honey, why didn't you go to cram school last night?",0
700,"Dad, I don't want to talk about it now.",0
701,"Honey, if you don't want to go to cram school, you should tell me the reason why.",0
702,"I'm sorry, dad. But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school.",0
703,"What's wrong with you, young man?",0
704,"Doctor, I have a bad cough and a headache.",0
705,Do you have a fever?,0
706,"I don't know, but I feel terrible.",0
707,Let me examine you. Don't worry. It's nothing serious.,0
708,Do you think I should lie in bed?,0
709,"Yes, stay in bed and drink a lot of water. Your fever will be gone in a day or two.",0
710,OK. Do you think I can play football tomorrow?,0

722,I love apple pie.,0
723,"Oh, I love apple pie too.",0
724,There you go. Problem solved.,4

735,I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters.,0
736,My name is Steven. I'm the Sales Manager of this company.,0
737,"Well, look here. Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly.",1
738,"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",0
739,"Never mind being sorry, what are you going to do about it?",1
740,"Don't worry, we'll soon fix them.",0
741,"Good, I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again.",0
742,I'll certainly look into that.,0
743,Thank you. Goodbye.,0
744,I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife.,0
745,"Yes, sir. What price range do you have in mind?",0
746,I'm not sure. I don't know very much about the price of pearls.,0
747,I see. Let me show you some samples of various qualities. This one is very nice. It's three hundred and fifty dollars.,0
748,Is there a price reduction?,0
749,We are having a sale now. The price has already gone down.,0
750,How much is that one?,0
751,It's two hundred and eighty dollars.,0
752,OK. I'll take it. Thank you.,4
753,Can I help you?,0
754,"Yes, I would like to buy a Walkman. Can you tell me about the models you have?",0
755,"Well, we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio?",0
756,Mostly cassette tapes.,0
757,Alright. There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good.,0
758,Kreng? I've never heard of that company.,6
759,"It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse, recording capability, and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone.",0
760,I suppose I don't want that one then. I don't like auto-reverse. It breaks too easily.,0
761,Really? Have you had an auto-reverse break before?,6
762,"Yes, twice now. I think it's too high-tech, and so it's the first part that breaks.",0
763,"Hmm. You know, the problem might be dust. Did you clean the unit often?",0
764,"Well. No, I didn't clean it.But still, I only had the last one two months, and it broke. I don't trust auto-reverse.",0
765,"Alright. Well. We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit. Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band, built-in microphone, recording capability, and no auto-reverse.",0
766,How much is it?,0
767,This one sells for $ 39.99.,0
768,Can I test it out?,0
769,Of course.,4
770,It sounds great. I'll take it.,4
771,Fine. I think you'll be happy with it. It's a very good unit. Very reliable. I'll go get you a new one in a box. I will be back in just a moment.,4
772,Thanks.,4
773,Tell me about yourself.,0
774,I was born and raised in Beijing. I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics. I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co. Ltd.,0
775,What type of position are you looking for?,0
776,I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience.,0
777,Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position?,0
778,"I am more interested in a full-time position. However, I would also consider a part-time position.",0
779,Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job?,0
780,"I advised customers on financial matters. After I consulted the customer, I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database. I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client. The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis.",0
781,What is your greatest strength?,0
782,"I am an excellent communicator. People trust me and come to me for advice. One afternoon, my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well. I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together.",0
783,What is your greatest weakness?,0
784,"I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied. However, I began setting time-limits for myself.",0
785,Why do you want to work for our company?,0
786,"After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years, I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team.",0
787,When can you begin?,0
788,Immediately.,0
789,Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules.,0
790,"Well, all right. There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents, information and other things.",0
791,What are they?,0
792,"They are keep the documents in chronological order, remove all the chips and pins, punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder.",0
793,And what is the most important point?,0
794,You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule.,0
795,This house is not looking all that great from here,0
796,You can’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside. Let’ s go inside.,0
797,I don’ t think that it is looking any better inside here.,0
798,I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.,0
799,It is just too dark in here with so few windows.,0
800,I hear that the kitchen is quite large. Let’ s go check it out.,0
801,"The kitchen may be large, but it doesn’ t have any storage space.",0
802,The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. Maybe it will be a little better.,0
803,How many dogs live in this house?,0
804,I think that we have seen all that we need to see here. Let’ s go look at another house.,0
805,Come on! It's time to go!,0
806,"Wait a minute! Just hold your horses! What's your hurry, anyway?",0
807,"Well, I've got to stop and get gas in the car, first.",0
808,That won't take long.,0
809,"Well, it won't if there no line at the pump.",0
810,"Well, I'm not quite ready.",0
811,"I'll give you five more minutes, then I'm going on without you!",1
812,You wouldn't do a thing like that!,0
813,"Oh, yes, I would!",1
814,Hello! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.,0
815,Not a problem. What time shall we call you?,0
816,"I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen.",0
817,It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen.,0
818,"Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7 thirty will you, please?",0
819,No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?,0
820,"No, that's about it for now. Thanks.",0
821,"Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.",0
822,Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff?,0
823,"Let me see. Laptop, flash disk, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a notebook, a pair of glasses, cell phone, charger, moisture lotion,... Oh, that is too much. You are not going to a business trip.",0
824,I guess I need all of them.,0
825,"Actually, the company will provide you with all of these supplies. So, you can leave this very thick notebook at home.",0
826,I know. But it is my lucky charm. I carry it all the time.,0
827,Suit yourself. Don’ t forget to set the alarm clock.,0
828,May I know where you are going?,0
829,Yes. I want to go to Beijing Hotel.,0
830,I'm sorry. You are going in the wrong direction.,0
831,Oh no! What shall I do?,0
832,Don't worry. You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. The bus stop is right there.,0
833,Thank you very much.,4
834,My pleasure.,4
835,"Steven, shall we go shopping tomorrow?",0
836,Hum... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow? Tomorrow is Saturday. I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping.,0
837,"But Sunday is the same with Saturday. If you don’ t mind, that's OK.",0
838,Hum.Maybe it will be better. The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work.,0
839,I see. We will go the day after tomorrow.,0
840,"By the way, what kind of stores do we need to go?",0
841,"I want to buy some clothes in clothing store. When we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken.",0
842,Let’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace. I want to buy one for you as your birthday present.,0
843,"Thank you, darling.",4
844,Good afternoon! Trans Pacific Airline. How can I help you?,0
845,I’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis. Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19?,0
846,"What’ s your name, please?",0
847,My name is Judy Wang.,0
848,"How do you spell your name, please?",0
849,"My first name is J-U-D-Y, and my last name is W-A-N-G.",0
850,Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation.,0
851,It’ s OK. Where should I pay for the penalty?,0
852,"At the airport. OK, Miss. Wang, your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled. Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a. m. on August 2.",0
853,That’ s 1POJ7403.,0
854,That’ s correct.,0
855,Thank you!,0
856,Is there anything else I can do for you?,0
857,"No, thanks. I’ m all set. Good-bye.",0
858,"John, I’ d like you to meet Charles Brown, our new manager at the airport.",0
859,"Yes, certainly. How can I recognize him?",0
860,"He is short, well-built, and he’ s got light blond hair.",0
861,Is there anything else?,0
862,"He has a mustache, if I remember correctly, and a light complexion.",0
863,How old is he?,0
864,He is in his late thirties.,0
865,Well. I shouldn’ t have any trouble recognizing him. What time does his flight arrive?,0
866,At 2 thirty.,0
867,What can I get for you today?,0
868,"Could I get a hamburger, please?",0
869,Would you like cheese on that?,0
870,"No, thank you.",0
871,Would you like a drink?,0
872,Let me have a soda.,0
873,What kind of soda would you like?,0
874,"May I have a Sprite, please?",0
875,"Sure, no problem.",0
876,I would also like a bag of chips.,0
877,Will that be all?,0
878,That's everything.,0
879,Please tell me something about your insurance background.,0
880,I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses. And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work.,0
881,Why do you want to be an insurance agent?,0
882,I care about people and I know the importance of insurance.,0
883,Do you have any work experience in promotion?,0
884,"Yes, I do. I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd.",0
885,Do people respond well to you?,0
886,"Yes, I'm good with people.",0
887,"Ah, here we are.",0
888,This is the place I was telling you about.,0
889,Would you like to sit near the window?,0
890,Good.,4
891,"Let's have a look at the menu. Oh, there isn't a menu. Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu?",0
892,"Yes, of course. Excuse me. Could you possibly let us see your menu? Oh. They haven't got one either.",0
893,Are you going to buy a bicycle?,0
894,I’ m thinking about it. How much is it?,0
895,¥ 350.,0
896,"Oh, dear. It’ s too expensive. Can you give me a better price?",0
897,"Your discount is already included. Normally we charge ¥ 400, but now we can give you a special price. This is our sale period.",0
898,It’ s still too much. Can’ t you make it any cheaper than that?,0
899,"Sorry, but this is the best price. You can’ t get it any cheaper than here.",5
900,I see. Can I pay by traveler’ s checks?,0
901,I'm afraid you can’ t. You’ re welcome to pay in cash.,5
902,Do you have a free moment?,0
903,Sure. What do you need?,0
904,I'm having some trouble. How do you use this printer?,0
905,"Well, first you have to turn this switch on.",0
906,Silly me.,5
907,Now press this button.,0
908,"Oh, and it's out of paper. Do you have any more?",0
909,Just a second. I'll go get some.,0
910,I need help using the washer and dryer.,0
911,Tell me what the problem is.,0
912,I can't figure out how to turn them on.,0
913,Do you have some quarters?,0
914,I didn't know I needed change.,0
915,The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.,0
916,Where do I put the change?,0
917,"The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.",0
918,Is that everything that I have to do?,0
919,That's all there is.,0
920,I appreciate you helping me with this.,4
921,"If you need anything else, just let me know.",0
922,Do you have any questions?,0
923,"Yes, do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation?",0
924,"Yes, after you’ Ve been here a year, you qualify for a three-day vacation",0
925,Only three days?,6
926,That's the company policy.,0
927,"What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year? If I’ m sick an extra day or two, will my pay be deducted?",0
928,Yes. That's the company policy.,0
929,It was the same as the last place I worked at. I was hoping you’ d be different.,5
930,I am absolutely famished.,0
931,Yeah. I am too.,0
932,Where did you want to go for lunch?,0
933,I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria.,0
934,I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria.,0
935,I actually like the food there.,4
936,Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food?,0
937,They have anything you want.,0
938,I was thinking about getting some Chinese food.,0
939,I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria. It tasted great.,4
940,We can eat at the cafeteria.,0
941,I think you'll really like the food there.,4
942,"Here is the draft contract, Mr. Brown. Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them. Then I will make out an original of the contract. After that, what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names.",0
943,That's OK.,0
944,The contract is to be written in Chinese and English. Both languages are equally effective.,0
945,"Fine. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to go it over first. ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm, you've done a pretty good job. It's well prepared.",0
946,Thank you.,0
947,"Well, I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time.",0
948,That's a good idea.,0
949,"First, let's read Clause Two about packing. It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers. That'll save time and money, but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases. So, we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract.",0
950,Agreed.,0
951,"For shipment, you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time. So would you allow us to make partial shipments.",0
952,I understand your position.,0
953,"How do you do? Nice to meet you, Diane.",4
954,"How do you do, Jack. Nice to meet you.",4
955,"Well, I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal, Diane.",0
956,"Yes, you are right. After all, the quality of your air conditioners is good. The only problem is price.",0
957,"I should not be surprised, many customers have the same opinion. Do you have any suggestion in mind? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable.",0
958,"That's why I came to your office today. We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable, because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649.",0
959,"That's true. But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product, you'll agree that 679 is not high, especially when we allow you a 10 % discount.",0
960,"I see your point. That's to say s 611 each set. Still it's much higher than the market price. Could you see your way to reduce the price, Jack?",0
961,"Well, considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600. That's the best we can do. What do you think of that?",0
962,All right. We accept it. So $ 600 for each set.,0
963,Very well. Thank you.,0
964,That's all the general information of our company. I think you already have good knowledge about our company.,0
965,"Yes, I have an overall understanding.",0
966,"When we have the final results, we will call you.",0
967,Then when will I get a reply at the latest?,0
968,"If you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks.",0
969,"But if I don't pass, will you call me?",0
970,"I'm sorry we won't. You can wait for two weeks. If you don't get a telephone call, it means that you weren't successful.",0
971,Then do I have the chance to get this job?,0
972,"I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself, and I have to discuss it with other interviewers.",0
973,"I know. No matter what the result will be, I have learned a lot from our conversation.",0
974,Your mentality is very good and that's great.,4
975,Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview.,4
976,My pleasure.,4
977,What kind of personality do you think you have?,0
978,I'm quite active and energetic. I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done.,0
979,Do you think you are introverted or extroverted?,0
980,I'm quite outgoing i think. I enjoy mixing and doing things with others.,0
981,What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy?,0
982,"I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends. A person can't live all by himself I think. A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have, the better.",0
983,What kind of people do you like to work with?,0
984,"People who are honest, dedicated to their work and having integrity.",0
985,Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student?,0
986,Yes. I was president of the Student Council of our university.,0
987,Did you get any honors or awards at your university?,0
988,Yes. I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years.,0
989,Were you involved in any club activities at your university?,0
990,Yes. I was a member of the Student Poetry Society. I like writing poems in my spare time.,0
991,What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college?,0
992,I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball.,0
993,I think Yoga might be suitable for me.,0
994,Why?,0
995,Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up.,0
996,But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too.,0
997,I don't know. I just need to try it once. I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight.,0
998,You should try swimming then. It helps you to keep fit.,0
999,"What's the matter with me, Doctor? I feel so tired these days.",0
1000,"Is your blood pressure, I'm afraid. It's far too high.",0
1001,And what's the cause of that?,0
1002,Overwork-amongst other things. You can't work 24 hours a day. You ' Ve got to slow down.,0
1003,But I can't just slow down.,0
1004,"You've got to, I'm afraid. And look at this. You weigh 200 stones. That's too much for a man of your size.",0
1005,You mean I've got to lose weight?,0
1006,Yes. You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise.,0
1007,"You are an early bird, Tom. What do you do in the morning then?",0
1008,Exercise. The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. We should not pass them up easily. Seize the time and do something useful.,0
1009,"So, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. Where do you exercise?",0
1010,"Usually, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. Admission is free. Then I start my activities.",0
1011,Do you do the same exercises every day?,0
1012,"No, I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars, push-ups, sit-ups, bunny-hops, five-kilometer run, and so on. I alternate them over the weekdays. Sometimes, when I find myself in a bad state, I will simply idle about in the park.",0
1013,Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising?,0
1014,"It's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. I fear that if I fail to get up early one day, I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. Besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. Here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. It's interesting to join them.",0
1015,"Oh, yes. Singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.",0
1016,"Steven, I'm going abroad by plane for the first time tomorrow. Can you give me some advice? And what should I pay attention to?",0
1017,"First, you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure. Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight.",0
1018,I will go to bed early tonight.,0
1019,Do you have an airsickness?,0
1020,I don't know. But I have a carsickness.,0
1021,You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness.,0
1022,Thank you.,0
1023,Can we choose a time to look at houses together?,0
1024,"Can you do that in the mornings, or would the afternoons be best?",0
1025,Either way is good for me.,4
1026,There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you?,0
1027,"I can take a little time off of work, or I can go on a weekend, also.",0
1028,"We could meet at the real estate office, or I could pick you up at your home.",0
1029,"I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at.",0
1030,I can think of five houses that we should look at. It will take most of the day.,0
1031,I would like to see as many as possible.,0
1032,"When I have confirmed the times with the owners, I will e-mail you our plans for the day.",0
1033,Do you have a package tour to Hollywood?,0
1034,"Yes, here is the table, which plans do you like best?",0
1035,The seven-days trip shall be fine. How much is this tour?,0
1036,$ 300.,0
1037,We will take the trip. Could you give us a pamphlet?,0
1038,Here you are.,0
1039,"Good morning, can I help you?",0
1040,I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up.,0
1041,"What kind of juice do you prefer, sir?",0
1042,Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong.,0
1043,"Yes, sir. American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. Breakfast juice and black coffee. And my correct, sir?",0
1044,"Yes, that’ s right.",0
1045,"Is there anything else, sir?",0
1046,"No, that’ s all.",0
1047,"Good morning, sir. I’ Ve got breakfast your ordered.",0
1048,Just put it on the table please.,0
1049,"Do you need anything else, sir?",0
1050,"No, thanks. Oh, yes, could I have some juice for the mini bar?",4
1051,What kind of juice do you like sir?,0
1052,"Tomato or orange juice, please.",0
1053,"Yes, sir. I’ ll get them for you right away. Would you please sign this bill first? Thank you, sir.",4
1054,What time does the train for Tibet leave?,0
1055,It will leave at 3:00 p. m.,0
1056,When does it arrive?,0
1057,It should be due in at 7:30 a. m.tomorrow.,0
1058,How much is the ticket?,0
1059,It's 86 coach and 175 berths,0
1060,"One berth, please.",0
1061,"Hey, taxi.",0
1062,"Where to, sir?",0
1063,Beijing Library.,0
1064,"Hop in, please.",0
1065,Is it a long ride to Beijing Library?,0
1066,It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour.,0
1067,"Thirty minutes, that will be all right. There are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open. Look, what are they doing on the square?",0
1068,It is an exhibition of Chinese jades. It is held each year. A nice collection jades of are on display and sold.,0
1069,Sounds great! Can you stop somewhere here for a minute? I will get some souvenirs for my friends.,4
1070,No problem.,4
1071,"How many pieces of luggage would you like to check in, sir?",0
1072,Three bags and a suitcase. This is my luggage to check.,0
1073,Do you have any carry-on luggage?,0
1074,No.,0
1075,"Put your luggage on the scale, please. Oh, your luggage is overweight.",0
1076,How much is the excess baggage part charge?,0
1077,Twenty-two dollars,0
1078,Here you are.,0
1079,"This is your voucher, and you can get your luggage back on this. Have a good trip!",4
1080,Thank you!,4
1081,"What date would you like to depart, sir?",0
1082,Do you have any seats for September 16th?,0
1083,Let's see... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. But I have seats for the 17th.,0
1084,The 17th will be fine.,0
1085,And what date will you be returning?,0
1086,"Hmm, I guess on the 28th.",0
1087,"Okay, you're booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing JFK at 6",0
1088,Sounds good. Thanks a lot.,4
1089,I would like to buy a black suit.,0
1090,Do you have any special brand in your mind?,0
1091,"No, I never wear suit in my everyday life. I just want one to take part in my sister’ s wedding ceremony.",0
1092,I see. Have a look at this one. It’ s very cheap because it’ s not very durable.,0
1093,but it looks good. Let me try it on.,0
1094,"Ok, the mirror is over there.",0
1095,Hi Jim. Do you have a minute?,0
1096,"Sure, what’ s up?",4
1097,Some of us are going to start a soccer team. Would you like to join us?,0
1098,I don’ t know anything about it. Soccer isn’ t as popular in my country as it is here.,0
1099,That’ s all right. We’ ll teach you.,0
1100,Is it anything like American football?,0
1101,"Not very much. It’ s something like hockey, except that you use a big ball and no stick.",0
1102,"I’ ll come down and watch you play some day, and see what it’ s like.",0
1103,Good idea. I think you’ ll like it if you give it a chance.,4
1104,Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for?,0
1105,"Yes, G stands for General Audiences, PG means Parental Guidance suggested, R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content.",0
1106,Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore?,0
1107,Remember when we were kids? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent.,0
1108,I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed.,0
1109,Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter.,0
1110,"Yea, I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either.",0
1111,Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't.,0
1112,"Reservation, can I help you?",0
1113,"Yes, I would like to reserve a room for next Monday.",0
1114,"Wait a moment, please. Let me check it.",0
1115,"By the way, I want a large room.",0
1116,"Right now we have a suite for 4 people, do you want to book it?",0
1117,"Yes, that's what I am looking for. I will take the room for 2 days.",0
1118,Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?,0
1119,"Sorry, I can’ t! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.",5
1120,"You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run so",0
1121,"Oh, I don’ t know... it’ s hard to find the right nanny. You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have",0
1122,"I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great",0
1123,"Oh, that’ s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won’ t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go",4
1124,Can you tell that I’ m excited?,6
1125,What are you excited about?,0
1126,I voted today.,0
1127,Was this your first time?,0
1128,I just turned 18 a month ago.,0
1129,You’ re lucky.,0
1130,What do you mean?,0
1131,Because you turned 18 in an election year.,0
1132,I didn’ t even think of that.,0
1133,You didn’ t?,6
1134,"I really didn’ t, but I’ m still excited.",0
1135,"You should be, because you’ re a part of history.",0
1136,Can I help you?,0
1137,Yes. I want to buy a pair of shoes.,0
1138,Have you a pattern in your mind?,0
1139,"Well, maybe sneakers or rubber shoes.",0
1140,Is there any special brand you would like?,0
1141,Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes? They look nice.,0
1142,"Look, how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is!",6
1143,What's Tiananmen famous for?,0
1144,"It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero, and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east.",0
1145,What's that?,0

1147,"All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive.travelling to China is very worth one.thank you so much for your guides, and I'll miss you.",4
1148,"I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed. What do you think? Damn, it hurts!",0
1149,We'll have to get you to a hospital. I can ride you on the back of my bike.,0
1150,I'm lucky I wasn't killed. I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner. I slid out.,0
1151,"Yes, I almost slid too.Alright. This tourniquet is tight. How does it feel?",0
1152,Make it tighter. I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut. Then we can go. Ouch! I hope I can walk.,0
1153,"Alright, I'm twisting it around. You tell me when to stop.",0
1154,There. Stop!,0
1155,"Mr.James. I know that office hour is up now, but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations?",0
1156,"Well, unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend. But let me see...",0
1157,"Oh, I'm sorry.However, if you could help me out, I'll double the pay for the hours worked.",0
1158,That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them?,0
1159,I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then?,0
1160,I'll try.,0
1161,"Thank you very much, Mr.James.",0
1162,Hi. I need to have my shoes repaired.,0
1163,What’ s the matter with them?,0
1164,Look at the heels. They are slanting.,0
1165,"Ah, I can do it perfectly.",0
1166,How much does it cost?,0
1167,6 yuan. And I can make them as new as before.,0

1175,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here.",5
1176,Really? Are you sure? I called before and he was there.,6
1177,Yes. I'm sure. You have the wrong number. I have used this number for more than 20 years.,0
1178,That can't be true. I remember the number clearly. Is your number 1199886?,0
1179,"No, it isn't. It's 1199866. It seems that you have misdialed.",0
1180,"Oh, I'm sorry I bothered you. I'm really sorry.",5
1181,It doesn't matter. It happens to everyone.,0
1182,Sorry again for bothering you.,5

1198,"Oh, that’ s very kind of you. I am going to the Garden Hotel.",4
1199,"I am going there, too. We can walk together.",0
1200,Sure.,0
1201,I'm interested in Chinese antiques.,0
1202,"We have a great variety of Chinese antiques. Besides, we have landscape painting, figure painting and flower-and-bird painting.",0
1203,I'd like a flower-and-bird painting.,0
1204,How about this picture of cranes with pine trees? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty.,0
1205,"Oh, they look just like live cranes.",4
1206,"And what is more, in traditional Chinese thinking, cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity.",0
1207,"Well, Mitzuko-san, I hope you like it here. This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei. It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe.",0
1208,It looks wonderful. Very authentic.,4
1209,The chef trained in Florence. The pasta is very good here.,0
1210,"OK. So, what can you recommend?",0
1211,Hum... You should try the mushroom fettucine. It's really good.,0
1212,Is it salty?,0
1213,Not at all. It has a very delicate flavor.,0
1214,What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that.,0
1215,"Oh, that means soup of the day. I'll ask the waiter what they have today. Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way? They're really delicious.",0

1225,"Oh, ah, um the Nikon D60 is a nice option.",0
1226,"Yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with? I don’ t want some bulky telephoto lens.",0
1227,"Oh, well this one has the, uh.",0
1228,"Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens. pretty standard, that will do. Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything!",0
1229,"So, ahem, can I interest you in any acc...",0
1230,Accessories? Do you carry polarizing filters?,0
1231,"Polarizing filter um we should! I’ m sorry, ma’ am. It looks like we’ re sold out.",4

1240,That's right. Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85.,0
1241,Thank you. You ' Ve been very helpful.,4
1242,I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music.,0
1243,You do? How are you going to contact him?,0
1244,I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen.,0
1245,What does it say? Do you think he'll see it?,0
1246,"He'll see it. It says, I like sweets. Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot.",0
1247,Can I spy on you guys from the window?,0
1248,No. But I'll fill you in later. Right now I have to find Vince.,0

1250,"No, you'll have to get off at the bank, and take a No. 50.",0
1251,Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop?,4
1252,One dollar.,0
1253,How many stops are there?,0
1254,Two stops after this one.,0
1255,Could you please tell me when we get there?,0
1256,Sure.,0
1257,"By the way, do I need a transfer again after No. 50?",0
1258,"No, a No. 50 will take you right there.",0
1259,Thank you.,4
1260,How are you wedding plans going?,0
1261,Very well. We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done. The only thing that isn’ t ready yet is my wedding dress.,4
1262,When will that be ready?,0
1263,The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks.,0
1264,"You’ re getting married in three weeks. So that should be ok. So, you’ Ve prepared the church, catering, transport, hotel-everything.",0
1265,Yes. We’ Ve taken care of all of that. We decided not to get married in a church though. Neither of us is very religious.,0
1266,Which hotel will the reception be held at?,0
1267,"The palace hotel they’ re taking care of the catering, including the wedding cake. I’ m sure they’ ll do a good job.",0
1268,"Oh, yes. It’ s and excellent hotel. A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, though very expensive.",4
1269,"Yes. It will be expensive, but we think it will be worth it. It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people.",4
1270,I think you make the right decision.,0
1271,You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.,1
1272,"Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening.",0
1273,"Well, the wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night.",1
1274,"Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.",0
1275,I knew you'd see it my way.,0
1276,"Sir, I deleted the $ 10, but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill.",0
1277,Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?,1
1278,"Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.",0
1279,This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!,1
1280,"If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.",0
1281,Mr. Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening. Here's an invitation for you.,0
1282,How nice of him. I'll be delighted to go. But what time would be convenient?,0
1283,"If you could be ready by, say 6:30 o'clock, I'll be at the hotel to pick you up.",0
1284,"That's great. It's most thoughtful of you to do this, Miss Rose.",4
1285,"It's my pleasure. Well, then. I'll say goodbye.",4
1286,Goodbye and see you tonight. Miss Rose.,4
1287,"Good morning, sir. May I see your passport?",0
1288,"Yes, of course. Here it is.",0
1289,Thank you. Are all these yours?,0
1290,"No, some of them are my friend's. Do you want her passport, too?",0
1291,"Yes, please. Do you have any carry-on items?",0
1292,"Do you want me to put it on the belt, too?",0
1293,"Yes, please. Would you please open this big suitcase?",0
1294,OK. Just a moment. It's just some clothes and toiletries.,0
1295,OK. Do you have anything to declare?,0
1296,I think there is nothing.,0
1297,"Any fresh food, live plants, or animals?",0
1298,"Oh, no. None of that.",0
1299,Thank you. You may lock up your suitcase. Here are your passports.,0
1300,Thanks a lot.,0
1301,Hello. I bought a China dress in your shop this morning.,0
1302,Yes?,0
1303,I bought it one size up by mistake.,0
1304,"Oh, did you?",0
1305,I wonder if you can change it to one size down.,0
1306,"Yes, of course.Will you come with the receipt?",0
1307,"Then I'll come to your place later in the evening, and how late is your shop open?",0
1308,"Until 8 o'clock, ma'am. We are looking forward to seeing you.",4
1309,I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit.,0
1310,"Why, do we need groceries?",0
1311,I believe we are all out of food.,0
1312,Do you know what to get?,0
1313,I don't know what we need.,0
1314,Why don't you go and check the refrigerator?,0
1315,I would appreciate it if you would do that for me.,0
1316,Why don't you just get the basics?,0
1317,What do you mean?,0
1318,"Eggs, milk, bread. Things like that.",0
1319,Go make that list.,0
1320,"Sure, no problem.",0
1321,Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game?,0
1322,I was unable to make it.,0
1323,You should have been there. It was intense.,0
1324,Is that right. Who ended up winning?,0
1325,Our team was victorious.,0
1326,I wish I was free that night. I'm kind of mad that I didn't go.,0
1327,It was a great game.,0
1328,What was the score at the end of the game?,0
1329,Our team won 101-98.,0
1330,Sounds like it was a close game.,0
1331,That's the reason it was such a great game.,0
1332,"The next game, I will definitely be there.",0
1333,Have you ever tried shopping online?,0
1334,"No, never. I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it, especially for clothes and shoes.",0
1335,That's right. Seeing is believing.,0
1336,"I've heard some friends say when they get the article, it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement.",0
1337,"That happens. Without close quality examination, we may encounter fraud, and the e-shop may suddenly disappear.",0
1338,"What's more, it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password.",0
1339,"It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem. Paying online is much safer than before, but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough.",0
1340,I can't agree more. that's why I only do street shopping.,0
1341,"Me too. Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information, and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping.",0
1342,That's a good idea.,4
1343,How long does it take to get to downtown from here?,0
1344,It is 15 minutes’ drive.,0
1345,What companies do we have in our neighborhood?,0
1346,"Mitsubishi, HP, IBM and many other famous corporations.",0
1347,Does the 7th floor belong to our company too?,0
1348,"Yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.",0
1349,It’ s such a large firm. Do we have our own staff restaurant?,0
1350,"Yes, at the end of the hall.",0
1351,"Good morning, sir. May I help you?",0
1352,"Good morning, I have an appointment with Mr. Johnson at 10:00",0
1353,"Excuse me, sir, but are you Mr. Richard of World Trading Company?",0
1354,Yes. That’ s right.,0
1355,"I’ m sorry, Mr. Richard. Mr. Johnson is on his way to the office. He had just called and asked you to wait a minute.",0
1356,"Well, I’ ll wait.",0
1357,"Would you like something to drink, sir? Do you prefer coffee or tea?",0
1358,"Thank you. Coffee, please.",0
1359,"Here you are, Mr. Richard. This is the cream and this is the sugar. If there’ s anything else you’ d like, please don’ t hesitate to tell me.",0
1360,Thank you very much.,0
1361,911. How may I help you?,0
1362,I need to report a break-in.,0
1363,When did this break-in occur?,0
1364,Last night.,0
1365,Where did the break-in happen?,0
1366,It happened at my house.,0
1367,Was anything taken?,0
1368,I'm not sure yet.,0
1369,What makes you think there was a break-in?,0
1370,My front window was busted.,0
1371,I'll send a squad car.,0
1372,Please hurry.,0
1373,"Good morning, everyone. Let me introduce myself to you...",0
1374,"You don't need to introduce yourself, Yang. You're famous.",0
1375,"Well, thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while.",0
1376,"OK, OK!",0
1377,"Now, I'd like to get things under way. The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U. S. sales strategy for the new EBB. I'd like to hear all of your ideas, Mr. Wall, you seem in top form today. Could you start the ball rolling?",0
1378,"Uh, oh, sure. Well, I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising.",0
1379,"Well, that's kind of obvious.",0
1380,"Give me a break, Mr Yang.",1
1381,"Uh, let's keep this going, shall we?",0
1382,"I’ m glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!",0
1383,"No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’ s hear more about these chocolates you’ re offering.",0
1384,"Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.",0
1385,"Mmmm, sounds interesting... gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?",0
1386,"Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.",0
1387,Really? I didn’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production,0
1388,"That’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!",0
1389,"Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth...",4
1390,"Unique, aren’ t they? I bet you’ Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’ s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.",0
1391,"Yes, very interesting flavors... Slightly spicy, very unique, that’ s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?",4
1392,"I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I’ m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.",0
1393,Haggis? What’ s Haggis?,0
1394,"It’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy, you take sheep’ s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep’ s stomach.",0
1395,"Ah, get back to you.",2
1396,Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?,0
1397,"Lucy, I’ d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder?",0
1398,"Monica, wait a moment. I think we’ d better call the repair man to do it.",0
1399,I think I can handle it by myself.,0
1400,I’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.,0
1401,"I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.",0
1402,Other company rules also need your attention.,0
1403,"Like this one? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah, thank you for telling me.",0
1404,Don’ t mention it.,0
1405,I didn’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why.,0
1406,Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form?,0
1407,I am afraid that I forgot to send it in.,0
1408,We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.,0
1409,Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now?,0
1410,It can’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.,0
1411,I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.,0
1412,"You can’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working. If you mail it in too soon, we will reject it!",0
1413,Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form?,0
1414,"Your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on time.",0
1415,I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.,0
1416,"I'm ready when you are, sir.",0
1417,"Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.",0
1418,"You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.",0
1419,I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my luggage?,0
1420,"Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $ 5 an hour, but you need to leave a deposit.",0
1421,A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?,0
1422,"I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely.",0
1423,Okay. Let me think about this.,0
1424,"Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.",0
1425,"Hey honey, how was your day?",0
1426,It was alright. I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while. He’ s in a bit of a jam.,0
1427,Why? What happened?,6
1428,"Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn’ t have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn’ t look into a couple of different HMO’ s.",0
1429,"Yeah, you’ re right. We aren’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.",0
1430,"Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO’ s with low co-pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too.",0
1431,"Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.",4
1432,"Well, we don’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine.",0
1433,I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.,0
1434,Not in a million years!,0
1435,Can I have a look at that digital camera please?,0
1436,Yes of course. This is a really good one actually.,0
1437,How much does it cost?,0
1438,This one is 1500 yuan.,0
1439,It looks pretty good. I think I'll take it.,4
1440,Would you like anything else?,0
1441,That's all thank you.,4
1442,I need something to wash this down. Is there any juice in the fridge?,0
1443,What is that? It looks like something from a swamp!,4
1444,It's a green drink. It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals.,0
1445,"You know, healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag.",0
1446,"The sales lady said that even if I eat right, I wouldn't get enough vitamins.",0
1447,Have you ever tried it? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady?,0
1448,It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day.,0
1449,"It may take less time, but I don't know about easier. Yuck.",0
1450,"Billy, you are late again.",0
1451,I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept. Is the manager here today?,0
1452,Yes he ' s in his office.,0
1453,"Oh, I hope he didn't notice me.",0
1454,Don't take any chances. It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again. He's already mad at you for last 2 times. Any more and he might fire you.,0
1455,You said it. It won't happen again. Do you really think he'd fire me?,0
1456,I think he might. You'd better go to his office.,0
1457,You are probably right. I'll go right now and apologize. I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic.,0
1458,Good luck!,0
1459,"Is there anything else, apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio?",0
1460,There is the Balance of Net Liabilities. This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years.,0
1461,"Right, OK. That, again, shouldn't be a problem.",0
1462,"And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average, for that particular industry, for the first two quarters of the year.",0
1463,"Well, as far as I can tell, we qualify.",0
1464,"Of course we will need proof, originals and duplicate of everything. As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it, it should be very quick indeed.",0
1465,What seems to the trouble Mr Brown?,0
1466,"I’ m in pretty bad shape, Doctor Ford.",0
1467,"Oh, In what way.",0
1468,"No appetite, always unaged and I can’ t sleep well.",0
1469,Did you lose any weight?,0
1470,YES. I’ Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month.,0
1471,when was the last time you have track up?,0
1472,About two month ago.,0
1473,"Let me take your blood pressure. You look anilic. Well, Mr.Brown. I’ m happy to say it’ s nothing serious. You just a little run down from overwork.",0
1474,What am I suppose to do?,0
1475,I think you’ ll needs just vacation. Try to get out doors more. I’ ll be sure if you get more rest.,0
1476,"Thank you, doctor. I’ ll do what you say.",0
1477,"May I see your passport, please?",0
1478,Certainly. Here it is.,0
1479,"You are here on business, I think?",0
1480,That's right. A German company has invited me for business talks.,0
1481,How long will you be staying?,0
1482,Just two weeks.,0
1483,How many pieces of baggage have you got?,0
1484,"Only one. In this case, I have a camera.",0
1485,Do you intend to take it out on your departure?,0
1486,"Yes, I do.",0
1487,"According to the regulations, the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free, but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country.",0
1488,I will.,0
1489,Well. Have a pleasant stay in Germany.,0
1490,Thank you.,0
1491,May I come in?,0
1492,"Yes, please. I’ m Mr. Peter, the Director of Personnel. What can I do for you?",0
1493,"Nice to meet you, Mr. Peter. I’ m Wang Sian. I’ Ve come for an interview as requested.",0
1494,"Oh, yes. How do you do, Miss Wang? Sit down, please.",0
1495,Thank you.,0
1496,What was your major in school?,0
1497,I majored in Public Relations.,0
1498,Have you done any work in this field?,0
1499,"Yes, after my graduation, I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year.",0
1500,What section did you work in?,0
1501,The export Business Section.,0
1502,So you must be very familiar with export procedures.,0
1503,"Yes, very much.",0
1504,That's good.,0
1505,"Where to, ma'am?",0
1506,The Grand Hotel.,0
1507,The Grand Hotel?,0
1508,Yes.Do you know where it is?,0
1509,"No, Madam. I don't think I do.",0
1510,"It's the 11th Avenue, Park Street.",0
1511,"Oh, yes. I know where it is.",0
1512,Do you have something to read?,0
1513,"Yes, I do.",0
1514,Could you lend me one?,0
1515,OK. Here you are.,0
1516,"Thanks. It's rather cold this morning, wouldn't you say?",4
1517,You're right.,0
1518,Do you know the news?,0
1519,Which one?,0
1520,Brazil wins the World Cup.,0
1521,"Yes, I see.",0
1522,We have the orientation this afternoon.,0
1523,What’ s going to be covered in the orientation?,0
1524,"The company introduction, our mission, vision, various policies, insurances, pension plan, company ID, batch, telephone, e-mail set-up and training.",0
1525,Quite a lot. All them one afternoon?,0
1526,"Yes, it is not easy.",0
1527,It is OK with me. I enjoy being busy and learning new things.,4
1528,"Excuse me, could you please show me the way to the human resource department?",0
1529,"Yeah, but have you made an appointment ahead?",0
1530,"Yes, of course. I am Monica. I have made an appointment with your HR manager.",0
1531,"Just a minute please. I’ ll make a call to the HR office. Yes, they confirm your appointment. Please come in. it is on the 3rd floor, room 3106. You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today.",0
1532,Thank you very much.,0
1533,You’ re welcome.,0
1534,Good morning. what can I do for you?,0
1535,I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift.,0
1536,You've come to the right store. We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from.,0
1537,I saw a pair of earrings outside your window. Can you show them to me?,0
1538,Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings?,0
1539,Exactly. How much do you want for them?,0
1540,They're only three thousand yuan.,0
1541,What is this setting made of?,0
1542,"Well, it's specially made of a platinum alloy, sir, and the lustre will never fade out.",0

1544,"You've made an excellent choice, sir.",4
1545,Room service.,0
1546,"Good morning. This is room 113. I'd like some breakfast, please.",0
1547,Right. Excuse me. Mrs. Jones?,0
1548,That's right.,0
1549,What can I do for you?,0
1550,"I'd like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast, and a pot of black coffee, please. How long will it take?",0
1551,"Just a few minutes, ma'am.",0
1552,Great. Thank you.,4
1553,"Hi, Sam. I want to buy a pet. Do you have any ideas?",0
1554,You really should go to Rachel's pet store.,0
1555,Why? anything special there?,0
1556,It's more than special. You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more.,0
1557,"Oh, really? are there any snakes?",0
1558,Snakes? there are even rodents and monkeys! it's a world of exotic pets.,4
1559,That's terrific. I can't wait to check it out.,4
1560,Hang on. are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet?,0
1561,Why not? it's so cool.,0
1562,But it will pose a risk to your health.,0
1563,Pardon?,6
1564,"I mean, most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria, they are likely to cause immune system problems.",0
1565,"Well, I didn't realize that.",0
1566,"I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets, especially for families with young children.",0
1567,"Oh, I should have thought of my brother's baby girl. Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet.",0
1568,"Yes, good luck, Maria.",0
1569,"Hello, this is room 1205. Our message lamp is flashing.",0
1570,"Hold on a minute, please.",0
1571,Thank you.,0
1572,I am sorry to have kept you waiting. Mr. Johns needs a telephone call from you.,0
1573,Would you bring the message to my room.,0
1574,I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment.,0
1575,Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately.,0
1576,"OK, we wait for you.",0
1577,guess what? I've got great news!,6
1578,what is it?,0
1579,"well, you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader, right?",0
1580,yes.,0
1581,"well, the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.",0
1582,really? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing?,4
1583,she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back.,4
1584,wow! That's really great news. How often does the magazine come out?,4
1585,"it's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly.",0
1586,are you looking forward to doing more editing work?,0
1587,"yes, but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again!",0
1588,do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine?,0
1589,"I don't have any with me, but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you.",0
1590,I'm really looking forward to reading your column.,4
1591,"me, too. Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news?",4
1592,"sure, where would you like to go?",0
1593,perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop.,0
1594,have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning?,0
1595,I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table.,0
1596,"you're right, thanks. There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish.",0
1597,who's the director?,0
1598,"it's Martin Scorsese. You liked his film, The Departed, didn't you?",0
1599,"yes, it was fantastic! Can I read the article when you're finished?",0
1600,"sure. You know it has an online edition, too. You should go online to read if you want to read it now.",0
1601,"that's ok. I'll wait until you're finished. Just out of curiosity, do you have a subscription for that magadize?",0
1602,no. I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile.,0
1603,how much does the magadize cost?,0
1604,"it's almost three pounds now, and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon.",0
1605,that's quite expensive. Who is their target audience?,0
1606,"Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership, but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore.",0
1607,"I bet you'll still buy it, though. You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine!",0
1608,Wei! This is a first-you didn't bargain!,4
1609,Bargain? I'd feel way too guilty.,0
1610,But you could have saved money.,0
1611,"From a sweet ma?! It's not worth it. Plus, I'd happily pay more for these things I bought!",6
1612,"F. Y. I., there is a flea market nearby, but maybe you're done...",0
1613,Ha! I'm just warming up! Please take me there now!,4
1614,Can you help me do an internet search?,0
1615,Sure. What do you want to find?,0
1616,I want to find information on the American Civil War.,0
1617,"Well, can you be more specific? There are a lot of websites about that.",0
1618,"Yes, I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg.",0
1619,"O. K. Well, go to google.com, and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg. ”",0
1620,"Oh wow, there are a lot of sites.",0
1621,"Here, try this one. It’ s a good site about Gettysburg.",0
1622,Thanks.,0
1623,"For detailed information, however, you should read a history book.",0
1624,"Thanks. If I’ m interested, I’ ll go to the library.",0
1625,Good afternoon. I'd like to speak with Tom Smith.,0
1626,I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment.,0
1627,Do you know when he will be back?,0
1628,He's away on a business trip. He won't be back until some time next week.,0
1629,Is there some way I can get into contact with him?,0
1630,The best way to reach him is by cell phone. I'll give you his number.,0
1631,"Thanks. And could I have his e-mail, just in case I can't get him by phone?",0
1632,"Sure. His cell phone is 09112223 33. And his e-mail is lower case t, smith--that's one word, at, c, c, w, dot, com, dot, t, w.",0
1633,Thank you so much. Does he read his e-mails daily?,0
1634,Yes. He usually replies immediately.,0
1635,Great. Thanks again. You've been very helpful.,4
1636,My pleasure. I hope you get a hold of him.,0
1637,"What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Brown?",0
1638,"I'm in pretty bad shape, Dr. Ford.",0
1639,"Oh, in what way?",0
1640,"No appetite, always on edge, and I can't sleep well.",0
1641,Did you lose any weight?,0
1642,"Yes, I have lost quite a few pounds since last month.",0
1643,When was the last time you had a check-up?,0
1644,About two month ago.,0
1645,Let me take your blood pressure. You look anemic.,0
1646,"Well, Mr. Brown, I'm happy to say it's nothing serious.",0
1647,You're just a little run-down from overwork.,0
1648,What am I supposed to do?,0
1649,I think all you need is just a vacation.,0
1650,Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest.,0
1651,"Thank you, doctor. I'll do as you say.",0
1652,"Good morning, Angela, how have you been lately?",0
1653,"Morning, Michael. I’ Ve been very busy lately. One of our other vendors is going out of business and I’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement.",0
1654,"Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run, sitdown.Coffee?",0
1655,"No, thanks. I’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine.",0
1656,"Haha, I could never do that. I’ d be a zombie if I didn’ t have my morning coffee fix. Let’ s get down to business then.",4
1657,"Yes. I’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone. The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market.",0
1658,That’ s great! I’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those?,4
1659,"No, we’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.",0
1660,Surely. Let’ s get started by drafting a new contract.,4
1661,Did you hear about the robbery?,0
1662,Did I hear about it? I saw it happen.,0
1663,Are you serious?,6
1664,I was there.,0
1665,What happened?,0
1666,A man came into the bank with a gun.,0
1667,That's insane.,0
1668,I was so scared when I saw the gun.,0
1669,Then what happened?,0
1670,He took the money and tried to get away.,0
1671,Did the cops show up in time?,0
1672,He didn't even make it out the door.,0
1673,hello! What are you reading about in the newspaper?,0
1674,"hello! I was exhausted form studying, so I decided to read the newspaper to relax. Unfortunately, the news is so depressing. There has been another murder in the city center. I’ m shocked that the pole",0
1675,people are starting to get frightened by it. Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder.,0
1676,you mean if they catch the murderer. I’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night.,0
1677,there must have been some good news in the newspaper. I can’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited.,0
1678,"well, there was one good piece of news. You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease?",0
1679,yes. Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states.,0
1680,"well, they’ Ve got the money and she’ s going tomorrow for treatment.",0
1681,I’ m so happy for the family! They must be very relieved and excited about that.,4
1682,"I’ m sure they are. Oh, and a local man won the lottery. I’ m so jealous! I wish it were me! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I’ m amazed that I haven’ t even won a small prize yet. It’ s so unfair!",5
1683,"don’ t be moody! I hope you’ re not tired, because we’ Ve been invited to a party this evening. I know how excited you get about parties.",0
1684,This is the Bell Captain's Desk. May I help you?,0
1685,"Yes, I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour. Where are they?",0
1686,"I'm very sorry to hear that. May I have your name and room number, please?",0
1687,"Yes, it's Yao Lan. Room 406.",0
1688,And how many pieces did you have?,0
1689,Two suitcases and a handbag. The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red.,0
1690,Is there a name tag attached to them?,0
1691,"Yes, there is.",0
1692,We're very sorry for the delay. I'll check immediately and call you back.,0
1693,Are you finished?,0
1694,Yes.May I have some more beer?,0
1695,"Oh, sure. I'll be back in a minute.Thank you for waiting. Here it is.Did you enjoy your meal?",4
1696,"Yes, the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much. I'm full.",4
1697,Is that so? I'm glad you enjoyed it.,4
1698,"By the way, Miss.Where is the toilet?",0
1699,Toilets are in the rear. I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment.,5
1700,What?,6
1701,It's especially cold when the wind is blowing.,0
1702,Why don't you wear a scarf?,0
1703,What can wearing one do for me?,0
1704,You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar. It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough.,0
1705,So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket.,0
1706,Yes. That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket.,0
1707,"You know, sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers.",0
1708,I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own.,0
1709,"Thanks, Pam. You're my lifesaver.",4
1710,"Hey, could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview?",0
1711,The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides. Do you know all about them?,0
1712,"Yes, I pretty much understand the company.",0
1713,"Well, after you've done your research, you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal. Have you decided what they are yet?",0
1714,"Yes, I've been observing them.",0
1715,"When you are choosing what to wear, keep all of that in mind. Have you chosen what to wear?",0
1716,I already have something to wear.,0
1717,I would always be ready to go shopping with you! Should we talk about other basics?,0
1718,"OK, I am ready to think of other things.",0
1719,"You need to make sure you arrive on time, smile, be pleasant and friendly, look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability. You'll do great!",0
1720,Is there anything I can do for you?,0
1721,Would you please show me that mural?,0
1722,Certainly. Here you are.,4
1723,It looks so beautiful. How much is it?,4
1724,Four hundred yuan.,0
1725,That's a bit more than I wanted to pay. Can you cut the price down a bit?,0
1726,I'm sorry. Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this.,0
1727,"Maybe you are right. OK, I'll take it.",0
1728,"Well, I'll have it wrapped for you.",4
1729,Thank you. Here is four hundred yuan.,4
1730,Thank you. Please come again.,4
1731,It’ s so great to be here! I’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home!,4
1732,We’ re glad that you’ re here. Would you like a tour of the house?,4
1733,"That’ d be great, but could I have a cup of tea first?",4
1734,"Sure, I’ ll just go put the kettle on. Why don’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen.",4
1735,"That would be lovely, thanks.",4
1736,Do you take milk or sugar with your tea?,0
1737,"I’ ll take a little milk, but no sugar, please. Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup.",0
1738,Ok. What do you think about our living room?,0
1739,"Well, I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table, but I don’ t really care for curtains. Did you get them at a yard sale? They look ancient.",0
1740,My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift.,0
1741,"Oh dear. Well, I suppose they will do for now. do you ever dust in here? It seems a bit dusty in here.",0
1742,"Your daughter usually does the dusting, and I do the vacuuming.",0
1743,"I see. Well, I can help with the chores while I’ m here. You two could probably use my help.",0
1744,"That’ s very nice of you to offer. Here’ s your tea. Be careful, it’ s still quite hot.",4
1745,"my lease ends next month, so I have to find a new place.",0
1746,I feel sorry for you. It's a jungle out there.,0
1747,Do you know any places?,0
1748,well. I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available.,0
1749,thank you. I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet.,4
1750,how much do are you looking to spend?,0
1751,"I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month.",0
1752,looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs.,0
1753,"it doesn't matter, but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route.",0
1754,anything you need to have in the place?,0
1755,"I want a bedroom with full bath, and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side.",0
1756,you can also check out university bulletin boards.,0
1757,why? Will those be students who are leaving?,0
1758,"not really, but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent.",0
1759,thank you. I'll be sure to take a look.,4

2123,"Oh, they're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think.",4
2124,"That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?",0
2125,One last question,0
2126,"Oh, no. Everything we sell here is "" as is. """,0
2127,I guess I was asking for too much.,0
2128,"If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.",0
2129,We have been over this a hundred times! We are not getting a pet!,1
2130,Why not? Come on! Just a cute little puppy. or a kitty!,0

2133,"What if we want to take a vacation? Who will we leave it with? Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.",0
2134,Ok. How about we get a cat or a ferret?,0
2135,"We’ re planning on having children soon, I don’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.",0
2136,Fine! Let’ s get a bird then! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk! A parrot would be awesome!,0
2137,"I’ ll tell you what, I can get you some hamsters and we’ ll take it from there.",0
2138,Yay!,4
2139,Over here is our gym. We have all the latest equipment.,0

2159,What? He can't do this to you.,6
2160,"Well, he did it anyway. Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah... you know.",1
2161,What did you do?,0
2162,I shouted it back of course.,1
2163,"Hold it, Mike. You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him, right? You worked it all up till now. Why not wait until you cool down a bit?",0
2164,What would you do if you were in my shoes?,0
2165,"Just stay cool. You know. When you get back home tonight, tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him.",0
2166,"No way, Kate. I mean it's just not my fault.",1
2167,"I know. It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first. And after that, you can casually mention the problem. I am sure he will cooperate.",0
2168,I am too angry to do that.,1
2169,What game do you like?,0
2170,I like board games. I like chinese chess and draughts.,0
2171,"I’ Ve never played Chinese chess before, but I’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street. It looks complicated.",0
2172,"It’ s about as complicated as chess. The basic rule and moves are simple enough, but there are many strategies that players need to learn.",0
2173,I like playing cards. I’ m pretty good at poker. Do you play cards?,0
2174,"I’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling, like poker. If I did, I’ d lose all my money.",0
2175,Do you play bridge?,0
2176,"Yes, I do. It’ s hard to find four players though, so I don’ t play very often. Do you know anyone who plays? If so, we could set up a game.",0
2177,"I can play quite well. I have a friend who likes playing, but she’ s not very good at it. Shall I invite her to play?",0

2179,I’ ll call my friend now. you call yours.,0

2187,"Oh hello, Sally. This is Dave Thomson here. Could I speak to Jim please?",0
2188,I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave. He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet.,5
2189,Any idea when he might be back?,0
2190,"Well, he shouldn't be long. He said he was just going to get some paint. But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back.",0

2246,I love this store. The only problem is that it’ s extremely expensive.,0
2247,Don’ t worry. I’ Ve decided that for your birthday I’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress.,0

2259,The hotel operator. Anything I can do for you?,0
2260,I've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes. But the line has been engaged all the time. Why is it taking so long?,0

2290,"OK, please.",0

2302,I also realized this issue. And office automation is essential.,0
2303,"Besides, Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age.",0
2304,Good idea. A network of work stations is helpful for our management.,0
2305,"And, to be frank, our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function.",0
2306,"You are right. The current equipment of our offices really falls behind. Next week, you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment.",0
2307,Thank your for calling World Airline. What can I do for you?,0
2308,I need to book a plane ticket to London.,0
2309,Round-trip or one-way?,0
2310,One-way.,0
2311,What date would you like to fly?,0
2312,"Saturday, July 25.",0

2348,"Oh, yes. I had a look yesterday. I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design. The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles. I’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter. I’ Ve got some idea of your exports. I’ m interested in your silk blouses.",4

2398,"All right, madam. When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store. I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 %.",0
2399,That is quite an achievement! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience?,0
2400,I don't think so. I'll create further achievement in the future.,0

2411,Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to City Hall?,0
2412,Yes. Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street. Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right. Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left.,0
2413,I'm sorry. I didn't follow you. Could you please repeat that?,0
2414,"Okay. First, go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street.",0

2416,"Then, walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right. Are you with me so far?",0
2417,Yes. I'm following you.,0

2429,"Yeah, maybe next time.",0
2430,I'll hold you to that.,0
2431,Sounds like a plan.,0
2432,I find that you spend little on handset charge every month. Have you any trick?,0
2433,It's simple. You can use call transfer.,0
2434,Is it so simple?,0
2435,"Sure. You know, we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day, so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone, so I need pay little for receiving calls.",0
2436,It's true.,0
2437,"Call transfer has many other advantages. When I am in places where network can't cover, such as the high building, I also use call transfer function, which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call.",0
2438,That's all?,0
2439,"In hospitals or on planes, handsets will interfere with some equip-ment, so we must close our handsets. If you set call transfer, the problem will be solved.",0
2440,I’ m going to be moving out soon.,0
2441,You still have time on your lease.,0
2442,There’ s no way that I can stay here.,1
2443,That’ s not going to be all right.,0
2444,I don’ t understand why.,6
2445,I’ m going to have to keep your deposit,0
2446,Why can’ t I have it back?,0
2447,Because you’ re leaving before your lease is over.,0
2448,You have to give it back to me.,0
2449,You’ re not going to get it.,0
2450,But I’ m not able to live here anymore.,1
2451,I can’ t help you with that.,0
2452,"Can I have my check, please.",0
2453,Here it is. 350 Yuan all together.,0
2454,May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it.,4
2455,Hearing you say that is a big reward for us. And here is the receipt.,4
2456,Thank you.,4
2457,Wait! Congratulations! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration.,4
2458,"Wow, it's surprising. So what do I get?",6
2459,You can have a free facial and then make up free for you. Do you want it now?,0
2460,Probably not. Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now.,5
2461,Here is our number. Call us when you are ready to come.,0
2462,You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time?,0
2463,Yes.,0
2464,Got it. Bye for now.,0
2465,Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer?,0
2466,"Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very c",0
2467,How often do you run your anti-virus program?,0
2468,I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time.,0
2469,Which anti-virus program would you recommend?,0
2470,Have you tried this one? It’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free.,0
2471,That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it?,4
2472,Just a minute... go to this one. I’ ll send you an email with the line in it. It only takes a few minutes to download. Then you have to go through the set up procedures. But they are not complicated.,0
2473,What do you use your computer for?,0
2474,"I use it for several things-surfing the net, word processing and creating presentations. I don’ t play many games on my computer, but I do a lot of work with photographs. Using a computer program, you",0
2475,"Computers are great, aren’ t they? I should download some programs and learn how to use them.",4
2476,A :: You must be Wily. It's nice to meet you.,0
2477,"B :: Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.",0
2478,"A :: Tim, please. Please be seated.",0
2479,B :: Thank you.,0
2480,"A :: So, Wily, you have been with IBM for two years, ready for change?",0
2481,"B :: Well, I think I'm ready for new challenges.",0
2482,Hello. Could you have a taxi pick me up before 10:00 a. m.?,0
2483,What is your address?,0
2484,I stay at No. 115 Fucking Road.,0
2485,"OK, a taxi will be there by 9:30.",0
2486,What are your rates?,0
2487,It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer.,0
2488,I have a lot of luggage. Will those fit in the taxi?,0
2489,Take it easy. I'll send a larger to pick you up.,0
2490,Thank you very much.,4
2491,"Hello Mr Waterstone, what can I do for you today?",0
2492,"Hello, Becky. Well, you see, I have this thing here, called a Fixed Deposit Certificate, and I've just noticed the date on it.",0
2493,"Oh, I see. You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew.",0
2494,"I think I'll redeem, if that's not a problem.",0
2495,"No problem at all, Mr Waterstone. Any preference as to how you want the money?",0
2496,"Anything you like, but not too many large notes. It's useful to have smaller notes.",0
2497,"Here we go, Mr Waterstone. Here's your money and your interest note.",0
2498,"Yes, yes. Everything's fine. Thank you very much, Becky.",4
2499,"What can I do for you, young man?",0
2500,I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning.,0
2501,What sizes do you need?,0
2502,"One pair of 37, and two pairs of 21. One for me, and the other two for two kids.",0
2503,Here you are. And here are three crash helmets.,0
2504,"Thanks. Well, those two kids are beginners. What should I do about their safety?",4
2505,"Well, there are a lot to do, but nothing to worry about. First, make sure they don't go far from the railings.",0
2506,"Oh, yeah, maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings.",0
2507,"That's a good idea. And remind them to be slow at the beginning, not to run into the railings.",0
2508,OK. Anything else?,0
2509,Never go to the center of the lake. The ice there is too thin to skate on.,0
2510,"Got it. Thanks for reminding me. And, are there any intensive training courses?",4
2511,Excuse me sir. May I come in?,5
2512,"Mike, you're late again.",1
2513,"I'm sorry, but my sister was ill, so I",5
2514,Do you think I believe the story like that?,1
2515,But it's true.,0
2516,How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week?,1
2517,That's coincident 。,0
2518,"Ok, hold it. Remember to be punctual next time 。",0
2519,I promise I will.,0
2520,You'd better.,0
2521,"Honey, I have something important to say.",0
2522,Something important?,0
2523,Yes. I have just booked two tickets.,0
2524,Tickets? What tickets?,0
2525,Two air tickets.,0
2526,Air tickets?,0
2527,Yes. We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow.,0
2528,We? The day after tomorrow? What are you talking about?,0
2529,"Today is June 18, isn’ t it?",0
2530,Yes. So?,0
2531,Think about it!,0
2532,Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow.,0
2533,Yes. Think about it carefully.,0
2534,"Oh, come on. Tell me please. Why did you book tickets to Paris?",0
2535,"Oh, honey! Don’ t you remember this important day to us?",1
2536,Sorry.,0
2537,It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20.,0
2538,Our 10th wedding anniversary?,0
2539,Of course. You completely forgot it.,0
2540,Darling. I think you have made a mistake.,0
2541,I have made a mistake?,0
2542,Yes. We married on July 20 ten years ago.,0
2543,July 20? But I think it should be June 20.,0
2544,"Yes. We had planned to marry on June 20, but something happened, so we had to put off our wedding day.",0
2545,Yes. I remember now. We put it off. I did make a mistake. But how shall we deal with the tickets?,0
2546,Since you have booked. Then let’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand.,0
2547,"Food is less expensive in a cafeteria, because you serve yourself.",0
2548,How to do it?,0
2549,"Just pick up a tray, then put a knife, a fork, a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line.",0
2550,How long will it take to reach the buffet?,0
2551,"Not long, because people rush for lunch.",0
2552,The line sure does move fast.,0
2553,Tell the man behind the counter what you want.,0
2554,OK. I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it.,0
2555,Just point to it if you don't know the name.,0
2556,All right.,4
2557,"Hey, did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend?",0
2558,"Yeah, but I'm still waiting for my invitation.",0
2559,Oh really? She gave me mine earlier today.,0
2560,"Well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.",0
2561,"Yeah, so are you planning on going?",0
2562,I think so. It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.,0
2563,"It really does, I can't wait.",0
2564,What time does the party start?,0
2565,It starts at 8 o'clock.,0
2566,"Oh, well, how many people has she given invites to so far?",0
2567,"I'm not sure, but I don't think she's given out that many.",0
2568,"Well, hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today.",0
2569,"Hey, Tom, did you enjoy your lunch?",0
2570,"Oh, don't mention it. It was terrible.",2
2571,What ' the matter?,0
2572,"The food station was as crowded as usual. I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone.",2
2573,I see. You simply can't blame the server for this.,0
2574,"Yes, I know. Fast food is so popular in this district.",0
2575,That's true.,0
2576,"Anyway, how was your such, Catherine?",0
2577,It was good. I brought lunch from home today.,4
2578,You did? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America.,6
2579,"Well, I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy.",0
2580,"I guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat.",0
2581,"Yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle, don't you?",0
2582,You bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.,0
2583,"Well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.",0
2584,Seriously?,6
2585,"Yeah, it's hard to believe but true.",0
2586,Have you seen this news article? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online.,0
2587,"Wow, that's really interesting. So who won?",4
2588,"Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.",0
2589,"I've been there! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art. The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds!",4
2590,"Cool! Also amongst the winners is Petra, in Jordan, Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico.",4
2591,"Wait a minute! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders. I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator!",4
2592,"Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.",4
2593,Good idea!,4
2594,"Hello, I'd like to reserve a hotel room.",0
2595,"That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?",0
2596,My name is John Sandals.,0
2597,"Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Michelle. What days do you need that reservation, sir?",0
2598,"I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17.",0
2599,"Our room rates recently went up. Is that okay with you, Mr. Sandals?",0
2600,How much per night are we talking about?,0
2601,Each night will be $ 308.,0
2602,That price is perfectly acceptable.,0
2603,Wonderful! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room?,0
2604,"Nonsmoking, please.",0
2605,"Next question, Is a queen-size bed okay?",0
2606,That sounds fine.,0
2607,"Okay, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is in our computer. All we need now is a phone number.",0
2608,Certainly. My phone number is 626-555-1739.,0
2609,"Thank you, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to seeing you in New York!",4
2610,"Good evening, Pizza House. This is Marty speaking.May I take your order?",0
2611,"Um yes. I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.",0
2612,We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead?,0
2613,"Sure, that sounds good.",4
2614,Great! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?,4
2615,"No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers. Oh, and make it thin crust.",0
2616,"Okay, thin crust. Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it’ s free!",0
2617,Perfect. Thank you. Bye..,4
2618,wait!! I need your address!,0
2619,What would you like to have for dinner? Chicken or beef?,0
2620,"Chicken, please.",0
2621,Good choice!,0
2622,What kind of drinks do you have?,0
2623,"Well, we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices.",0
2624,"In that case, let me have a glass of orange juice.",0
2625,Anything else?,0
2626,I would like to have some tea as well.,0
2627,Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea.,0
2628,I see.,0
2629,I'd like to apply for a credit card. Can you help me with my application?,0
2630,I'd be glad to.,0
2631,I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history. I just came to this country.,0
2632,Do you have an account with this bank?,0
2633,I'm afraid not.,0
2634,In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also. That would help with your credit card application.,0
2635,What is the interest rate on your card?,0
2636,The annual charge rate is 9.5 %.,0
2637,That's very expensive!,0
2638,Not really. The credit card is a revolving account. You only pay interest on what you owe.,0
2639,How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges?,0
2640,You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized.,0
2641,Does the card provide any other benefits?,0
2642,"You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card.",0
2643,"You're really fit, Paul. Do you exercise very much?",0
2644,"Well, I almost always get up very early, and I lift weights for an hour.",0
2645,You're kidding!,4
2646,No. And then I often go Rollerblading.,0
2647,Wow! How often do you exercise like that?,0
2648,About five times a week. What about you?,0
2649,"Oh, I hardly ever exercise. I usually just watch TV in my free time. I guess I'm a real couch potato!",0
2650,I don't believe we've met.,0
2651,"No, I don't think we have.",0
2652,My name is Gao Run.,0
2653,How do you do? My name is James Green.,0
2654,Here's my name card.,0
2655,And here's mine.,0
2656,It's nice to finally meet you.,4
2657,"And I'm glad to meet you, too.",4
2658,Marketing Manager’ s Office. Can I help you?,0
2659,"Mr. Smith, please.",0
2660,"Sorry, he is out.",0
2661,What time do you expect him back then?,0
2662,"Sorry, I am not sure. Can I take a message?",0
2663,"No, thanks. I will call back later.",0
2664,That’ s fine. Please call again later.,0
2665,OK. Thank you. Goodbye.,0
2666,Can I help you?,0
2667,"Yes, I need some traveler's checks.",0
2668,How much do you need?,0
2669,Three thousand US dollars.,0
2670,"All right, can I have your passbook?",0
2671,"Yes, here you go.",0
2672,What amounts do you want the checks in?,0
2673,It's all the same to me.,0
2674,Here you are.,0
2675,Thanks.,0
2676,The plumbing in my new apartment is not working.,0
2677,I need you to tell me what the problem is.,0
2678,The bathroom sink is stopped up.,0
2679,"Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing?",0
2680,Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem.,0
2681,"Did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?",0
2682,Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago.,0
2683,Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem?,0
2684,I am not sure if I will be home later.,0
2685,"I will be coming by around 10 this morning. If you aren’ t there, I’ ll just use my key.",0
2686,Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome!,4
2687,It's more violent than TV news!,4
2688,What time is it anyway?,0
2689,Nine-thirty.,0
2690,"Oh, my God, three hours already! I have to get the chores done!",4
2691,No time. That's their headlights in the window!,0
2692,"OK, emergency measures. Let's throw the dishes in the trash! Two birds with one stone...",0
2693,"Little dude, your life is over!",0
2694,No time to worry. We have to dispose of this evidence.,0
2695,How old is Keith?,0
2696,He's 21. How old is James?,0
2697,"He's a year older than Keith, but he looks younger.",0
2698,How's your father?,0
2699,He's fine. He retired last week. It's a turning point in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.,0
2700,He can spend more time with his grandchildren.,0
2701,"Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.",0
2702,"So, he wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!",4
2703,How do you want to spend your old age?,0
2704,"In the same way, probably.",0
2705,Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department?,0
2706,"Sure, let me take a look... Personal Information, Education, Experience, Training... I think you should add another section for language. You speak three languages, so you might as well put that on your resume.",0
2707,But languages don't have anything to do with engineering. Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field?,0
2708,"Not necessarily. I think people would be impressed by your language abilities. It says something about your level of intellect and experience. Also, I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume.",0
2709,"It's just a piece of paper, you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it?",0
2710,"Well, you're right, the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person. That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper. But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer.",0
2711,what did you do last night?,0
2712,I just stayed at home and watched TV.,0
2713,did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game?,0
2714,"yes, it was a very evenly matched game.",0
2715,what were the results of the game?,0
2716,it ended in a tie.,0
2717,what was the actual score?,0
2718,it was three all.,0
2719,really? I thought Barcelona was going to win. They are a much better team than Madrid.,0
2720,"if Barcelona had played as they normally do, they should have won.",0
2721,what happened?,0
2722,"their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal, but he kept on playing anyway.",0
2723,that explains it.,0
2724,how many more games are left this season?,0
2725,that was the last game before the playoffs.,0
2726,when do the playoffs start?,0
2727,in a few weeks. Are you planning on watching them?,0
2728,of course! I really love watching football games on TV.,4
2729,"Me, too! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together.",4
2730,"sure, that would be great.",4
2731,"Ok, it's a date then!",4
2732,"Excuse me. I bought this shirt yesterday, but I would like to refund it.",0
2733,"Gave me the receipt, please.",0
2734,Here is my receipt.,0
2735,What's wrong with it?,0
2736,It's too small for me to wear.,0
2737,Would you like another bigger one?,0
2738,No thanks. I want to have a refund.,0
2739,"OK, here is your money.",0
2740,"Oh, so many kinds of winter hats.",4
2741,"What is your favorite color, miss?",0
2742,Red.,0
2743,Here you are.It ' s very attractive.,4
2744,May I try it on?,0
2745,Go ahead.,0
2746,Is there a mirror around here?,0
2747,Right over there.,0
2748,Does it suit me?,0
2749,"Yes, you look very nice.",0
2750,How much is it?,0
2751,We're having a clearance sale. $ 4 plus tax.,0
2752,That's quite reasonable.,4
2753,What can I help you with?,0
2754,May I ask you something?,0
2755,What's your question?,0
2756,How many hours behind the wheel do I need?,0
2757,What do you need to take it for?,0
2758,I'm trying to get my license.,0
2759,You need six hours.,0
2760,Can I do all six hours in one day?,0
2761,You have to do it in three days.,0
2762,That's all I have to do?,0
2763,That's everything.,0
2764,"Well, that's a relief.",4
2765,"Excuse me, I have something to trouble you.",0
2766,Yes? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you.,0
2767,"An hour ago, I bought this vase with my tourist.",0
2768,"Oh, yes. I remember it clearly. Is there anything wrong with it?",0
2769,I'm afraid so. We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel.,0
2770,"Oh, how awful! Let me have a look, I'm terribly sorry. It was most thoughtless of me. Would you excuse me, please?",0
2771,"Oh, It's quite all right, I suppose. It can't be helped sometimes.",0
2772,It's very kind of you to say so. How about changing another one for you?,0
2773,All right. Thank you.,4
2774,"Just a minute, please. I won't be long. I'm sure this one is perfect. You may examine it carefully.",0
2775,"Oh, yes, it is. I'll take this one.",0
2776,I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you.,0
2777,"Well, there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing.",0
2778,Here you are. You left the medicine here.,0
2779,Sorry. I was too worried.,0
2780,I firmly believe that you love your brother very much.,0
2781,"Absolutely. By the way, do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine?",0
2782,"Yes, we have some Chinese medicine for common cold.",0
2783,I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure.,0
2784,It depends. It's true that you can take some for prevention.,0
2785,What kind of place shall we rent?,0
2786,"It should be close to the university. Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.",0
2787,Absolutely. That's the most important thing to take into consideration. I'm not too worried about the size of the flat.,0
2788,"Neither am I. So a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. Do you mind if it's in a noisy area?",0
2789,"I don't mind. i'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.",0
2790,"Good point. Ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.",0
2791,"Yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.",0
2792,How much do you think the rent will be?,0
2793,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.,0
2794,I have a terrible toothache.,0
2795,Which tooth is it?,0
2796,This one here.,0
2797,"Ar, Yes. There’ s a big cavity.",0
2798,Can you fill it?,0
2799,I’ m afraid not. The tooth is too far gone. it'll have to be taken out.,0
2800,Then I might as well have it done now.,0
2801,"you’ d better wait, the gums are swollen. Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days.",0
2802,Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment?,0
2803,The local newspaper has ads for housing.,0
2804,Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with?,0
2805,Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate.,0
2806,What do landlords charge for rent?,0
2807,"Would you like an apartment for just yourself, or do you need it for two people?",0
2808,"There are two of us, but we only need a one-bedroom apartment.",0
2809,You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month.,0
2810,I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me.,0
2811,"Sure, I’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want.",4
2812,The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge.,0
2813,"Unfortunately, it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford.",0
2814,Why is the price so high?,0
2815,"It's not just that the price is high, it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly.",0
2816,Model of computers aren't compatible?,0
2817,Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities.,0
2818,"Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out, the price of this model will become more affordable.",0
2819,"But by then, the technology will be outdated.",0
2820,"True, but our focus has never been affordability anyway. Coastwise, we may not be very competitive, but qualitywise, we definitely have an edge.",0
2821,"That's right, no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable.",0
2822,"This model has advanced technoledge, superior components, it is compact, and it's a top-quality product.",0
2823,I guess you get what you pay for.,0
2824,Hello! How do I get more amenities?,0
2825,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.",0
2826,"I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.",0
2827,"Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.",0
2828,"No, no. I've got plenty left.",0
2829,Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?,0
2830,What am I going to do about souvenirs?,0
2831,"Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!",4
2832,"Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.",0
2833,"Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a discount.",0
2834,Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs.,0
2835,"I understand completely, sir. Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment.",0
2836,Excuse me. Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo?,0
2837,"Well, you can take the No. 36 bus from here, but then you have to walk about 30 minutes.",0
2838,That doesn't sound too bad.,0
2839,"Actually, if you go to the bus stop in the next block, you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo.",0
2840,Maybe that's what I'll do. Thanks a lot.,4
2841,You're welcome.,4
2842,How are you?,0
2843,I’ m doing well.,0
2844,How may I help you?,0
2845,Could you cancel a check for me?,0
2846,What’ s the problem?,0
2847,I wrote the check out for way too much.,0
2848,How much?,0
2849,I wrote the check out for $ 150.,0
2850,What were you supposed to write it out for?,0
2851,I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100.,0
2852,I’ ll just cancel it for you right now.,0
2853,That’ s great. You’ re a lifesaver.,4
2854,"Would you like to take a look at the menu, sir?",0
2855,Yes. Thank you.,4
2856,Would you care for a drink before you order?,0
2857,A glass of Qingdao beer.,0
2858,"Yes, sir. I'll bring it over. Have you decided what you'd like, sir?",0
2859,Will you make some recommendation?,0
2860,"I’ m taking BA fright 123 to London. Can you tell me where the reporting desk is, please?",0
2861,"Yes, Madam. The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there.",0
2862,Thank you so much. Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London?,0
2863,"Yes, this is the right desk. Have you any luggage?",0
2864,"The suitcase, that’ s all. Except my handbag. Of course.",0
2865,Would you please put you suitcase on the scales? You needn’ t weigh your handbag.,0
2866,Is there a receipt?,0
2867,Yes. I’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket.,0
2868,What must I do next?,0
2869,You must go to immigration to the departure lounge.,0
2870,It's time for bed.,0
2871,"But I'm not sleepy, Mum. Can I stay and watch more TV?",0
2872,"It's already half past eleven. You have school tomorrow. You'll sleepy all tomorrow, if you don't sleep well tonight.",0
2873,I know. But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow. I work really hard.,0
2874,Don't you have the exams coming up soon? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those.,0
2875,"Oh, I nearly forgot the exams.",0
2876,"You do well in maths, but your history is not good enough. Am I right?",0
2877,"Yeah, I guess so. Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow.",0
2878,An excellent idea. Work now and play later.,4
2879,"I know you're right. School is more important than TV. Can I watch one more show, then go to bed.",0
2880,"No, now it's bedtime.",0
2881,"Yes, madam? Can I help you?",0
2882,"Oh, yes, please. But you are just closing, aren't you?",0
2883,"Well, yes, we are, madam. The shop shuts down in five minutes.",0
2884,I shall not keep you long then. It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week.,0
2885,"Last week, madam? I really can't remember which ones you mean. What were they like?",0
2886,"Oh, they were lovely. Sort of imitation wood, dark brown color, country-style you know, and the lids, if I remember rightly, they had a sort of leaf pattern, or was it flowers?",4
2887,That's strange. I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description. Are you sure they were in this shop?,0
2888,"Oh, you must know the ones I mean. They were on sale, a real bargain. Reduced to a quarter of the original price. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them.",0
2889,"I am afraid the sales are over now, madam. And you know we all sold out of the saucepans.",5
2890,"I don't think you did, you know. My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday.",0
2891,"Well, it's all new stock in the window now.",0
2892,"May I just have a look, to see if there is anything else?",0
2893,"Eh, well, madam, as you know we are closing.",0
2894,"Yes, yes, I am sorry I won't keep you. It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time. But they were such beautiful saucepans. I’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot.",0
2895,"Perhaps madam, if you come back tomorrow, I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware. And there are still one or two things at the sale price.",0
2896,"Oh, look! That was the one there. That is the sort of thing I was looking for. But it's not quite the color.",4
2897,"That might be the artificial lighting, madam. Of course, if you could come back in daylight, you might find it’ s exactly what you are looking for.",0
2898,"There it is. That is the pattern! The set behind you. Thank goodness, they haven't been sold. And thank you so much for being so patient with me. Yes, those are the ones.",4
2899,I've come to hear about your offer.,0
2900,"We have the offer ready for you. Let me check. 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box, at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box, at 7, 500 yuan, for shipment in June. The offer is valid for five days.",0
2901,I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.,0
2902,You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where.,0
2903,I am afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.,0
2904,"But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.",0
2905,I agree that yours are of the top.,0
2906,"Well, since your order is large enough, can you give me a rough idea?",0
2907,"To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help.",0
2908,Impossible. How about 5 % off?,0
2909,Right. A reduction of 5 % is acceptable.,0
2910,Hello! This is Ruby speaking from G. O. T. International Travel Agency. What can I do for you?,0
2911,I’ d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline.,0
2912,Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket?,0
2913,I’ d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return.,0
2914,Economy or Business Class?,0
2915,"Economy, please. How much is it?",0
2916,It will be $ 850.,0
2917,Very good. Could I get an electronic ticket? I’ m always afraid of losing my tickets.,0
2918,No problem. How do you wish to pay for it?,0
2919,Bank of American card. The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657.,0
2920,Thank you! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat?,0
2921,"An aisle seat, please. I’ m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often.",0
2922,No problem. Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p. m. on April 13. You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p. m. on April 14. Your electronic,0
2923,What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport?,0
2924,Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in. You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure.,0
2925,What happens if I can’ t leave on April 13? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date?,0
2926,"Yes, you can, but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation.",0
2927,That’ s OK. What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage?,0
2928,"On Trans Pacific international flights, each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds.",0
2929,That’ s great! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each. I think I’ m all set. You’ re really efficient. Thank you very much for your help.,0
2930,Thank you for the compliment and for calling G. O. T. Travel Agency. Have a nice trip!,0
2931,That looks graceful on you.,4
2932,Thank you.But it is too bright for me.,4
2933,How about this brown one?,0
2934,Let me try it on. I like that color.,0
2935,"Ok, i will get one for your.Here you are.",0
2936,But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size?,0
2937,"Sorry, it had been sold out.",5
2938,What a pity!,5
2939,I’ d like to apply for a personal loan.,0
2940,How much would you like to borrow?,0
2941,A thousand dollars.,0
2942,Let me check with a credit manager. A record show your credit reading is quite high. I don't think you have any problems.,0
2943,What’ s the current interest rate?,0
2944,Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance. Would you please fill out the application the form?,0
2945,And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside.,0
2946,"When you flip the tie up, he's right side up. Brilliant.",0
2947,My dad will love this. He's a Dilbert fan.,4
2948,I wouldn't mind having one myself...,0
2949,Model it for me.,0
2950,OK!,4
2951,Wow! You look just as dorky as Dilbert!,4
2952,"Welcome. What can I do for you, Madam?",0
2953,"I hope you can give me some advice. I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills. It's such a long way from my home, but I checked and you are my nearest branch. Is there anyway I can do it from home?",0
2954,"That's terrible. Unfortunately, we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town. What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service.",0
2955,A Direct Debit Service? What's that exactly?,0
2956,"A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account, no fuss, no hassle.",0
2957,"But how will you know how much I should pay? I mean, I receive my bills, not you.",0
2958,"We set up an agreement with the, say, phone company. They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account. Of course, we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies.",0
2959,"I see. So, that would mean that every month it would just come from my account? That does sound like a good idea, totally trouble free.",0
2960,Hello.,0
2961,Hi. It’ s Tony calling from the dentist’ s office. Is Lily there?,0
2962,"No, Lily is not here at the moment.",0
2963,Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in?,0
2964,"Sure. What’ s your number, please.",0
2965,519 367 8901.,0
2966,"Thanks. And your name is Tony, right?",0
2967,Yes. I’ m Tony. Thank you very much.,4
2968,You’ re welcome. Bye.,4
2969,Bye.,0
2970,So what do you think of my new dress?,0
2971,"I think it's great! I really like the color, and it goes really well with your eyes. I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now, but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment.",4
2972,"Um, ninety-five dollars?",0
2973,"Yes, that's the price they were advertising it at. I was hoping it might go on sale soon. Why, how much did you pay for it?",0
2974,I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique. I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else.,0
2975,"Of course! Everything at Helen's is overpriced, and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store! Why didn't you shop around?",0
2976,"I don't know, I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it. I guess I was too impulsive.",0
2977,"In foreign trade, exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner.",0
2978,How to adjust?,0
2979,"Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs, wants and likes.",0
2980,"Ah, some products are successful at home, but not be popular overseas.",0
2981,"That's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably.",0
2982,"Yes, sometimes the differences are great.",0
2983,"Well, we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product.",0
2984,We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales.,0
2985,Shall we share a taxi?,0
2986,Where are you heading now?,0
2987,I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house.,0
2988,Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College?,0
2989,That's the one.,0
2990,You mean we'll share the taxi?,0
2991,"Yeah.If we share the cab, it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully.",0
2992,"Well.Don ' t worry about it, I will be happy to share the taxi with you.",4
2993,Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu?,0
2994,My name is Liu Lichi. How do you do?,0
2995,"How do you do? Please be seated, How is your trip here?",0
2996,"Quite good, I think. I came here by bus, and it took me about 15 minutes.",0
2997,"Oh, yes.How old are you?",0
2998,Twenty.,0
2999,"Hum, still a student?",0
3000,"Yes, I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics.",0
3001,What subjects are you studying?,0
3002,"English, math, commercial and legal studies, and accountancy.",0
3003,Have you had any working experience.,0
3004,"Well, I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays.",0
3005,What do you like to do in your spare time?,0
3006,"I like sports very much.Besides that, I also like working on a computer in my spare time.",0
3007,How are your English and computer skills?,0
3008,I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing.,0
3009,"Okay. Mr.Liu, we'll inform you of the results within a week.",0
3010,That dress is very pretty. Why don’ t you like it?,4
3011,It’ s too loud.,0
3012,We’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for?,1
3013,"Well, you know, those styles or colors don’ t suit me.",0
3014,What style do you want?,0
3015,"I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater, and it should be tight.",0
3016,"Oh, I see.How about the color?",0
3017,Quiet color.,0
3018,I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters.,0
3019,Really? Let’ s go there.,6
3020,"Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?",0
3021,Sure! What do you feel like having?,4
3022,I really feel like having a big juicy steak!,4
3023,"Oh. OK. I don't eat meat, but that's fine, I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right?",0
3024,I didn't know you were a vegetarian!,6
3025,"I'm not, I am a vegan.",0
3026,A what?,0
3027,"A vegan. I don't eat or use any animal based products. I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.",0
3028,Wow! That's interesting! It must be tough!,4
3029,"It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.",0
3030,How do you feel about that restaurant?,0
3031,It wasn't all that great.,0
3032,What did you dislike the most?,0
3033,I don't think that they had their act together. They didn't seem well prepared.,0
3034,Did you think that the food was any good?,0
3035,I wasn't all that impressed by the food.,0
3036,The service certainly could have been better.,0
3037,The service did not help the situation.,0
3038,Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to?,0
3039,I am not interested in trying this restaurant again.,2
3040,Let me see your passport. Is London your final destination?,0
3041,No. I am a transit passenger going to Sweden.,0
3042,How long are you going to stay here?,0
3043,Only one night.,0
3044,Do you have any dutiable items?,0
3045,"No, I don't.",0
3046,What are these?,0
3047,They are my personal effects.,0
3048,"I heard that you finished my home inspection, and I was wondering how it went.",0
3049,"First of all, we need to understand what I was looking for. Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is?",0
3050,I am not sure what a home inspection is all about.,0
3051,"I went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren’ t surprised when you move in.",0
3052,Wouldn’ t the owners have told me about any problems?,0
3053,"Sellers aren’ t always truthful, and there might also be problems that they aren’ t aware of.",0
3054,Can I require the owners to fix the problems?,0
3055,You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems.,0
3056,What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home?,0
3057,There were no major problems. One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found.,0
3058,What can I do for you today?,0
3059,I have a question.,0
3060,What do you need to know?,0
3061,I need to take the driver's course. How many hours do I need?,0
3062,It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course.,0
3063,I need to get my license.,0
3064,You're going to need to complete six hours.,0
3065,How many hours a day can I do?,0
3066,You can do two hours a day for three days.,0
3067,That's all I need to do to finish?,0
3068,"Yes, that's all you need to do.",0
3069,Thanks. I'll get back to you.,4
3070,Would you like your bags to be taken to your room?,0
3071,"Yes, please.",0
3072,OK. I'll get the bellman to taka them up. Which bags are yours?,0
3073,"My luggage is in the corner over there. They are the leather suitcase, the canvass holdall and the blue backpack.",0
3074,OK.,0
3075,"Please be careful with the suitcase, it's very heavy.",0
3076,"I'll let the bellboy know. Don't worry, he's very strong.",0
3077,"And the holdall has some fragile items inside, so please be careful with that too.",0
3078,Of course.,0
3079,How far do we have to go?,0
3080,About 50 miles.,0
3081,"The traffic is not very heavy on this high way, is it? So I’ m sure we’ ll make it.",0
3082,"No, but we’ Ve got a hurry. It will be the rush hour soon.",0
3083,Don’ t worry. There’ s plenty of time yet.,0
3084,"But it’ s Friday today. This road is always jam packed during the weekend, isn’ t it?",0
3085,Right.,0
3086,May I help you?,0
3087,"Give me a Big Mac, a small order of French fries and a medium Coke.",0
3088,You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries. They are still in the fryer.,0
3089,That's fine.,0
3090,Your total comes to $ 7.,0
3091,Here's a twenty. Could you give me some more napkins?,0
3092,Sure. Your cash back is $ 13. And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes.,0
3093,Thanks.,4
3094,Hi. I’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York.,0
3095,May I see your ticket please?,0
3096,Here you are. Do you need to see my passport?,0
3097,Any form of picture I. D. will do.,0
3098,Mmmm... a photo I. D. I have my New Jersey driver’ s license. Is that ok?,0
3099,That will do. What an interesting picture! How old is it?,4
3100,"Actually it wad taken just last year, but I had a shaved head and a beard. Can you still recognize me?",0
3101,Barely. Will you be checking any luggage today?,0
3102,"Yes, One suitcase. I also have a carry-on bag.",0
3103,"Ok. Mr. Lee, you’ re all set. Your flight leaves from gate 10. Boarding begins at 10:30",0
3104,Which university did you graduate from?,0
3105,I graduated from Peking University.,0
3106,What was your major at university?,0
3107,"I studied economics, I am especially interested in the economic development of China.",0
3108,What course did you like best?,0
3109,"I like Business Management, and i think it's very useful for the present work.",0
3110,What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking?,0
3111,"I've taken courses on office administration, reports and correspondence writing. I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager, because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork.",0
3112,Have you ever shopped online?,0
3113,"Quite often. It is very convenient, saving me a lot of time.",4
3114,Do you have some experiences to share with me? I want to have a try.,0
3115,"You are asking the right person. Here are two very important tips. First, you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices. I can recommend you some online merchants. Second, write your mail address correctly. Otherwise, you can’ t receive your delivery in time.",0
3116,What about the registration procedure? Is that complicated?,0
3117,"Not at all. You just need to provide your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and bank or credit card information. I will help you with that.",0
3118,It is so nice of you.,4
3119,"Hey, you look great! how's everything?",4
3120,"Yeah, you know what? I've been going to the club regularly. The training really pays off. Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit.",0
3121,Really? tell me about it. I haven't gone to the club for a long time. I am too busy with work.,0
3122,It's important to do proper exercises.,0
3123,You're right. Too much or too little won't do any good.,0
3124,"The trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet.",0
3125,Sounds reasonable.,0
3126,We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.,0
3127,And fruits!,0
3128,Surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.,0
3129,I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?,0
3130,"Yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. That can also help one to keep sound physical health.",0
3131,"I think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track.",0
3132,You bet it!,4
3133,"You have a lovely house, Jack.",0
3134,Thank you. But a number of things have been going wrong lately.,5
3135,That's too bad. What problems are you having.,5
3136,"Oh, the whole house needs re-painting for starters. The carpet in the living room is worn out, and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting. Last week, I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet. Anyway, all par for the course when you own a house, I guess. I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over.",0
3137,I've studied home decoration as a hobby. Could I make some suggestions?,0
3138,Go right ahead.,0
3139,"Well, I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room, and maybe some new drapes for the windows. Also, a grandfather clock would look great in the den. Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room",0

3207,You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid.,0
3208,Can I send it in now?,0
3209,"You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due. If it hasn’ t been, we will still accept it.",0
3210,Can I mail it in early next time so it isn’ t late?,0

3356,I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car.,0
3357,You don't want your insurance company to pay for it?,0

3442,That’ s very good. I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful.,0
3443,What was so bad about it?,0
3444,"Small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work.",0
3445,Sounds bad! Lucky you! You didn’ t take that job. I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently.,0
3446,"Totally agree. By the way, the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506. You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor.",0
3447,"Now, if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English?",0

3451,"Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca. So how about extracurricular activities at University?",0
3452,"Well I’ Ve always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the University student magazine, which I really loved. Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter, to help the homeless in York.",0
3453,What did that involve?,0
3454,"Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months. I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.",0
3455,"I’ m sure. Okay, now let’ s move on to your work experience, shall we?",0
3456,"Yes, okay.",0
3457,"Now, what seems to be the trouble?",0
3458,"It's nothing serious. But I always have a headache, and I haven't slept properly for several weeks. I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning.",0
3459,"Mm, you do look rather pale. Let me take your temperature. Would you put the thermometer under your arm, please? Now, let me listen to your pulse. Mm, do you feel weak?",0
3460,"Yes, I never seem to have any energy.",0
3461,I'll give you a blood test. Would you roll up your sleeve? Just as I thought. You're anemic. You'd better pay more attention to your diet. Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein. And don't stay up late working. Try to get more rest.,0
3462,Thank you.,0
3463,"Excuse me, I would like to know something about this campus. Right now it seems very big and confusing! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing.",0

3466,Do you know where your classes are?,0
3467,"More or less. I go to three different buildings, and always get there late. I feel so hopeless. I don’ t know why I am late all the time. No one else seems to be.",0
3468,That's because you don't know the short cuts. You'll learn them after a while. I can show you the ropes.,0
3469,Will you be voting?,0
3470,I can’ t wait to vote.,0
3471,Who are you voting for?,0
3472,The person I’ m voting for is the best.,0
3473,What do you like about him?,0
3474,He is very intelligent.,0
3475,You think so?,0
3476,"That’ s right. Plus, I agree with his policies.",4
3477,I’ m glad to hear that you are so excited.,4
3478,I’ m voting for the next President.,4
3479,I’ m sure he will be.,4
3480,I’ m going to make sure and vote.,0

3483,"One moment, please, sir.... Here's your bill. Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct?",0
3484,What's the 14 pounds for?,0
3485,That's for the phone calls you made from your room.,0
3486,Can I pay with traveller's cheques?,0
3487,"Certainly. May I have your passport, please?",0

3494,"I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and I am decisive.",0
3495,What things impress you in your colleagues?,0
3496,I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity. I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment.,0
3497,What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked?,0
3498,"The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others. I want to hear good and bad feedback in private, so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions. I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior.",0
3499,How do you organize and plan for major projects?,0
3500,"I love to brainstorm a best, worst, and most likely scenario.Then, I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react.",0
3501,Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure.,0
3502,"I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible, because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system, so we located everything we needed.",0
3503,How do you manage your time in a typical day?,0
3504,"I've always given priority to work with established clients, because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence, especially internal correspondence, which I take care of at the end of the day or week.",0
3505,Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion.,0
3506,I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings.,0
3507,Want to send out for some Chinese?,0
3508,Some what?,0
3509,"Some Chinese food. I'm hungry, and there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat.",0
3510,"No, I'd rather go out. The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home. Maybe we can try some other food today... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day, the one over in the shopping center?",0
3511,"Okay. I could go for that. It's called Al's Steakhouse. They also have great fried fish, and I love their salad bar. You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like.",0
3512,Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat?,0
3513,"Yes, their steaks are enormous. Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered.",0
3514,What if that happens to me? I hate to let food go to waste.,0
3515,Don't worry. We'll just get a doggie bag.,0
3516,Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us?,0
3517,I know something about it. Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills.,0
3518,"It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures, so I can not bear it anymore. It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills.",0
3519,Is that true?,6
3520,Definitely!,0
3521,"If that information is exact, I guess our company is willing to promote someone.",0
3522,"Hello sir, how may I help you?",0
3523,"I would like to buy some flowers, please. Something really nice.",0
3524,"I see, may I ask what the occasion is?",0
3525,"It’ s not really an occasion, it’ s more like I’ m sorry.",0
3526,Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends. It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out. It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness.,0
3527,I think I’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear. What else do you recommend?,0
3528,"Mmm, well this is our I’ m sorry I cheated on you package. Two dozen red roses lined with tulips, carnations and lilies. The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you.",0
3529,I don’ t think that’ s gonna cut it. I need something bigger and better!,0
3530,"I’ m sorry sir but, what exactly did you do?",6
3531,"Well, I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier.",0
3532,"Get out of my store, you jerk!",1
3533,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights?,1
3534,"I'm very sorry, sir. I could put you on a waiting list, but you would be wise to check out other means of travel.",0
3535,You mean like a bus? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before?,1
3536,I have not sir. But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here.,0
3537,"Alright, give me the number. But put me on that waiting list as well.",0
3538,"Here is the number, and your name is on the waiting list.",0
3539,How many people are on the waiting list right now?,0
3540,Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list. And you are number 176.,0
3541,I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past.,0
3542,I know. It really makes a mess of the whole election process.,0
3543,And it takes up all the news.,0
3544,The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up.,0
3545,"It's so small. The fact that there is public interest, doesn't say much for us as the public.",0
3546,Have you ever listened to AM radio? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio.,0
3547,I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio.,0
3548,Another place you can get real insight is European papers. You can get them on-line.,0
3549,"Hello, Miss Wu, This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited. I'd like to check my last order. When exactly was it sent out?",0
3550,I can check that for you right now. Would you mind holding?,0
3551,Sure. No problem.,0
3552,"Mr. Robson, I'm sorry. Our computer system is down. Could I call you back later?",0
3553,Sure. Do you have my number?,0
3554,"Yes, I have it right here. I'm so sorry about this.",0
3555,No problem. I'll wait for your call.,0
3556,What are you typing there?,0
3557,I'm working on my resume.,0
3558,Really? Did you find any information about a new job?,6
3559,"Yeah, I just got some good information off the internet.",0
3560,Great! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job?,4
3561,I didn’ t just find out about one job. There were several ones that looked good.,0
3562,Maybe I should try looking on the web for work.,0
3563,Sure you have to be patient. But I think it’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls.,0
3564,But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net. You might have no chance.,0
3565,How do you know if you don’ t have a try?,0
3566,Would you please show me the necklace in the window?,0
3567,Is this the one you want?,0
3568,"No, the one next to it.",0
3569,Here you are.,0
3570,Thanks. What kind of stone is this?,0
3571,It's a ruby. It is from South Africa. Would you like to try it on?,0
3572,"Yes, please. How much is it?",0
3573,It costs $ 200.,0
3574,It looks good. OK. I'll take it.,4
3575,"Happy birthday, Jim!",4
3576,"Thank you, Lisa.",4
3577,Here is a present for you. I hope you like it.,4
3578,"Oh, great! I love it! You know I've been expecting this for a long time.",6
3579,I'm very glad to hear that.,4
3580,"Come here, let me introduce some friends to you.",0
3581,What's wrong with you? You look pale.,0
3582,"I'm not sure, I feel hot and cold.",0
3583,When did the trouble start?,0
3584,I was sick most of the night.,0
3585,It sounds like you are coming down with the flu. Let me take your temperature.,0
3586,Have I got a high fever?,0
3587,"Yes, thirty-eight point seven. Do you have a headache, chest or throat pain?",0
3588,"Yes, I have.",0
3589,"Now, let me have a look at you. I'd like to listen to your chest. Now breathe in, a deep breath, that's it Cough, now again. I want to examine your throat, too. Open wide, say ' Ah - - '",0
3590,"Aaaaahh, aaaaahh.",0
3591,"Yes, it does look a bit sore. Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests.",0
3592,"All right, thanks.",0
3593,The tests showed nothing wrong. A slight viral infection.,0
3594,What shall I do today?,0
3595,"I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins. Take an aspirin when you've got a fever, and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours, and go home and rest in bed for two days. Drink plenty of water, then you'll feel better. Here's the prescription.",0
3596,I called HP about my computer.,0
3597,What did they say?,0
3598,They said I need a new hard drive.,0
3599,That's too bad. How much is a new one?,0
3600,"It's not too much, only about $ 85.",0
3601,Plus installation?,0
3602,"No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.",0
3603,Really?,0
3604,"Yes, it's just a couple of screws.",0
3605,That's nice.,4
3606,It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60.,0
3607,"If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.",0
3608,Is there anything wrong?,0
3609,I’ m worried about my daughter. She can’ t decide about college.,0
3610,Don’ t worry. That’ s just a part of being a teenager.,0
3611,I don’ t mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything.,0
3612,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn’ t affect her decision.,0
3613,But I just want to give her some tips.,0
3614,"Oh, she can make her own decisions.",0
3615,I guess you are right.,0
3616,Believe me. Everything will be ok.,0
3617,I hope so.,0
3618,"that was a really good meal, Gordon.",4
3619,It sure was. I couldn't eat another bite.,4
3620,"well, it is getting pretty late. I think we should go home.",0
3621,you're right. I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow.,0
3622,let's see how much the bill is.,0
3623,don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat.,0
3624,what are you talking about? We'll split the bill.,0
3625,"no, I insist. I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't.",0
3626,"no way, Gordon. I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.",0
3627,"alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill.",0
3628,"that's better. This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk.",0
3629,"just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week, ok?",0
3630,you've got a deal.,4
3631,great. Bye.,4
3632,bye.,4
3633,I hear you are planning to travel abroad.,0
3634,Yes. I'm going to the Untied States for travel. What places do you recommend?,0
3635,"In my opinion, there are several places you mustn't miss, like Washington D. C, Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles.",0
3636,Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii.,0
3637,"Yes, you may consider those two places also. Seattle, for example, is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight.",0
3638,And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing. That must be a great place. I can't miss it.,0
3639,This looks like a very nice house.,4
3640,"You know, I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it.",4
3641,The style of the exterior is just what I’ Ve been looking for!,4
3642,The exterior is only half of the story. The interior is incredible.,4
3643,This home is gorgeous on the inside!,4
3644,"Everything that you see on the walls, floors, and windows is brand new.",0
3645,The wall colors totally suit the style of this house.,4
3646,Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen.,0
3647,I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops.,4
3648,The master suite is the best. Let’ s go look at that next.,4
3649,"There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed, and I love the light in this room.",4
3650,"I know that you like this house, but let’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind.",0
3651,Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you?,0
3652,Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino?,0
3653,Sure. When do you want to take the plane?,0
3654,Next Monday.,0
3655,Will that be first class or economy seat?,0
3656,What's the fare for a first class seat?,0
3657,$ 200.,0
3658,Oh. I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please.,0
3659,Welcome to the company. We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company.,0
3660,That's easy. It was your office ergonomics that decided me.,0
3661,You're kidding! Something as simple as that?,6
3662,"Yes. It is very important to me. My mother worked in offices for twenty years, and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome. I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries, and I know that t",0
3663,"Yes, there has been a lot of research into RSI's. Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries. Tell me, did anything else influence your decision?",0
3664,"Yes, I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days. I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff.",0
3665,"Well, welcome to the team.",0
3666,Lin's office supplies. How may I direct your call?,0
3667,Marry Lin please.,0
3668,"Sure, just a moment.... I'm sorry no one answer the phone.",0
3669,"All right, could I leave a message?",0
3670,Certainly!,0
3671,Please ask her to call John.,0
3672,Excuse me. Where is the way out?,0
3673,"Well, that's what I'm looking for myself.",0
3674,"It's very confusing in here, isn't it?",0
3675,"Absolutely. Oh, do you see a sign there?",0
3676,It should be the way out.,0
3677,OK. Let's go and see.,0
3678,"Hi Joe, how are you doing today?",0
3679,"Things are going good today. How have you been doing, Mary?",0
3680,"Things are going well for me, Joe.",0
3681,Want to go see a movie tonight?,0
3682,My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.,0
3683,"Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night, instead?",0
3684,What movie did you want to see?,0
3685,There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer.,0
3686,I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees. ”,0
3687,Oh great! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to!,0
3688,How's the bride-to-be?,0
3689,Tired and stressed. This wedding is giving me a headache.,5
3690,"Just relax. With me as your maid of honor, everything will be fine!",4
3691,I'm worried that everything will be chaotic!,3
3692,Hey! I'm the tour guide. I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests.,0
3693,"You're going to have to tell them what to do in church, what everything means...",0
3694,I will. Don't worry!,4
3695,Jim? Jim?... What are you doing in the kitchen?,0
3696,"Nothing, Mummy. I was hungry so I came here for some milk.",0
3697,Milk? I thought you didn't like milk.,6
3698,"I don't, but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator.",0
3699,Nonsense. There's lots of food in the refrigerator... What's behind your back?,0
3700,Nothing.,0
3701,What are you hiding behind your back? Let me see.,0
3702,Promise that you won't get angry.,3
3703,"OK, I promise. What is it?",0
3704,It's a kitty.,0
3705,"Oh, Jim. I told you. No pets. It'll make a mess of this house.",1
3706,"Please, Mummy. Everybody else in my class keeps a pet. Please, I'll take care of it. It's a good kitty. It'll not bring you any trouble.",0
3707,No way. It might belong to somebody else. You can't keep it here.,1
3708,"Please, Mummy. I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin. It was starving and looking for something to eat. Please! You see, it's so cute and tame.",0
3709,All right. But you have to clean up everything it messes up.,0
3710,"I will. Thank you, Mummy.",4
3711,I was wondering if you could help me with something.,0
3712,"Sure, anything you say.",4
3713,"Actually, it’ s a little bit silly.",0
3714,"Don’ t worry about it, just ask.",4
3715,What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes?,0
3716,You need to know the type of shoes you want.,0
3717,Don’ t worry about that. I can point it out in the store.,0
3718,"The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable, too wide, too narrow, or just right ; and long or short. In girls shoes, the heel can be high or low.",0
3719,Let me write all that down. I’ m going shopping this afternoon.,0
3720,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest.,0
3721,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West.,0
3722,"No, absolutely not! On the contrary, you'll be considered a well-connected, sociable man, if you keep involved in the conversation all the time. But always pay attention to what you say. If the table has a senior guest, say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible. Or maybe, you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested.",0
3723,"You mean, keeping a low profile in the presence of the old? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings, right?",0
3724,"Correct. Show respect for the older people. Conventionally, before the meal starts, the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one. Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite. Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other.",0
3725,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest?,0
3726,"Yes, plenty of them. Don't eat fast! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others. And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely.",0
3727,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient?,0
3728,"Haha, I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate.",4
3729,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink... Could you make an order for a new set?,0
3730,"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock.",0
3731,"You can double check with the housekeeping department, but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to the supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance, they can usually fill the order.",0
3732,"OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure. Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?",0
3733,"I think the only thing is toner. Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis. Anyhow, see what you can do to expedite the order this time.",0
3734,"OK, will do.",0
3735,May I help you?,0
3736,I'm looking for a pair of shoes.,0
3737,What size do you wear? These shoes are on sale.,0
3738,I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on?,0
3739,"Of course, yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive.",4
3740,How much are they?,0
3741,They are $ 168.,0
3742,I'll take them.,0
3743,A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days. He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it. He recommended me to subscribe to it. What do you say?,0
3744,I think it is good if we know enough about career planning. We will make wiser choices. What else did he tell you about it?,0
3745,"Well, just something in general, like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals.",0
3746,"Sounds practical! To be honest, sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.",0
3747,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. It seems that you need this course more than I do. I love my current job. If I take this course, I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work. If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships, that will be great. I need these to improve my current work performance.",0
3748,"Ok, then we can sign up for it together.",0
3749,"Hi, I think I was supposed to call for my test results today.",0
3750,"If you go onto our website and put in your password, you can access your test results.",0
3751,Are you saying that there weren’ t any problems?,0
3752,I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem.,0
3753,Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them?,0
3754,"Yes, if you go there, you can see what each test is about.",0
3755,How will I know what the numbers mean?,0
3756,You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range.,0
3757,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before?,0
3758,We put all of your test results up in the same place. Just check the dates for what you need.,0
3759,"This is our rock-bottom price, Mr. Lee.",0
3760,If that's the case. there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.,0
3761,What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great.,0
3762,I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible. How about meeting each other halfway?,0
3763,What's your proposal?,0
3764,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want. Well, I suggest we meet each other halfway.",0
3765,Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible!,0
3766,What would you suggest?,0
3767,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off. That's definitely the lowest we can go.,0
3768,That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars. Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with.,0
3769,OK. We can meet halfway again.,0
3770,Hello.,0
3771,"Good morning, Ruth. Did I wake you up?",0
3772,"No, I was just about to get up. What's up, Carl?",0
3773,"Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus?",0
3774,B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown.,0
3775,"Oh, you mean Canal Street?",6
3776,That's the wrong direction. Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown.,0
3777,"Oh, I get it. When did we decide to meet?",0
3778,"At 10,45. Is Ann coming along?",0
3779,I cannot get hold of her yet.,0
3780,"See you around, Carl.",0
3781,See you later.,0
3782,Has your company been affected much by government legislation?,0
3783,"Yes, we have. We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards.",0
3784,What about your use of raw materials?,0
3785,"Well, we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more.",0
3786,What happens if you exceed the limits?,0
3787,We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine.,0
3788,"I don’ t want you to be worried, but our son has some bad habits now. He says painful words everyday.",0
3789,What words? Can you tell me?,0
3790,"He says kick mommy, beat mommy, don’ t want mommy, very quickly if I do something that he doesn’ t like. You know, if I wash his face or change his clothes, things like that.",0
3791,"Honey, I don’ t know what to tell you. Of course Tony is a young child. But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason.",0
3792,"Yes, but sometimes he is just not reasonable.",0
3793,"I suggest you treat him with patience, affection, and respect. If he needs to do something, like go to bed, or be washed, etc., please guide or help him to get it done, but lead him with gentleness.",0
3794,"It’ s easy to say, but I will try.",0
3795,"Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior. Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods, etc. Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire.",0
3796,"I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him. But this doesn’ t work, instead he picks up another bad habit.",0
3797,How can I help you?,0
3798,"Yes, I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates. I would like to see Mr. Smith.",0
3799,Do you have an appointment?,0
3800,"Yes, he knows I'm coming. Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock.",0
3801,I wonder if Mr. Smith forgot your meeting. I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm. Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place. Will you please have a seat?,0
3802,Sure.,0
3803,"Yes, Mr. Mason, I just checked with our office manager, Ms. Terry, she said Mr. Smith briefed her on your project. She is just finishing up a meeting now. She could be with your shortly. Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting?",0

3813,"I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, but I don't think he won anything.",0
3814,"Tom Cruise may be handsome, but I think he's a bit crazy, don't you?",0
3815,"yes, his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous.",0
3816,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves.,0
3817,people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated.,0
3818,I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you.,0
3819,that's true. I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go.,0

3832,"OK, wait for a moment. Well, I am sorry, but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins. In this case, you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs.",0
3833,It doesn't matter.,0

3835,Thanks a lot. Good-bye.,0

3838,"Well, I prefer to go on the train, but I suppose you want me to take the car.",0
3839,"Oh, I much prefer to go by car, then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and...",0
3840,And I've got to drive. You know I'm not fond of that. I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train.,0

3923,I saw her yesterday.She was a little better.,0
3924,Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there?,0
3925,"No, you needn't. A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital.",0
3926,"Number 13 buses run much more frequently, don't they?",0
3927,"Yes. I caught a number 7 bus yesterday, and they said I had taken a wrong bus.",0

3972,"I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that. I don’ t think we should use an agency, because they won’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ. Have we decide on the location of",0
3973,"Yes. We have. We chose the location in the northeast of the city, not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD.",0
3974,Why didn’ t we choose an office in the CBD?,0
3975,The offices there were too expensive. Have we negotiated any contracts yet?,0
3976,Yes. We’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries. We hope to sign another three this month.,0

3978,Hopefully next month. Everything is a little rushed. We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly.,0

3997,do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter?,0
3998,"I know this is going to sound sexist, but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children.",0
3999,"why not? It's their children, too.",0
4000,"that may be true, but when a woman gets pregnant, it changes her life completely. Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand.",0
4001,"that might be true, but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter.",0

4026,Why not use staircases? The terror was not so violent at that time.,0

4064,"I'd love to, the movies are smash hit.",0

4070,"Yeah, a number of times.",0
4071,What's he trying to pull anyway.,0
4072,I don't know. But this is definitely the last straw.,0

4144,"All superstitious nonsense! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say, just for kicks.",0
4145,"Can I help you, sir?",0
4146,"Yes, I'd like a book about law.",0
4147,Would you tell me the name of the book and the author?,0
4148,"Uh, the Origin of Law. And it's written by Professor Felix of Harvard.",0
4149,I'm sorry. It's out of stock now. Could you come by again next week?,0
4150,Next week? It is too late. I need it urgently.,0
4151,"Well, then, is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it?",0
4152,"No, thanks any way.",0
4153,You're welcome.,0
4154,"Hello, is this the ABC company?",0
4155,"Yes, may I help you?",0
4156,"We have just arrived from Tokyo only... looking for a reserve car of your company. All of above, we cannot find it.",0
4157,What is your reservation number?,0
4158,Our reservation number is J - 221.,0
4159,"Let me see. Oh, yes, we have your reservation number.",0
4160,You mean you haven’ t arranged any car?,6
4161,I’ m sorry to say no.,0
4162,"Here I’ ll take taxi instead, how do you refund us?",0
4163,What kind of gas does this car take?,0
4164,I don't know. It's a rental.,0
4165,I will give you premium unleaded. Alright?,0
4166,"Sure, why not?",0
4167,That is the pump you are in front of.,0
4168,Is it expensive?,0
4169,It is the most expensive.,0
4170,"Well, I don't want it then. Can I move to another pump?",0
4171,"Yes, I can give you regular unleaded. But you have to back up the car a little.",0
4172,Give me regular unleaded then. I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me?,0
4173,"I'm sorry, sir. This is not a full service gas station. I will help you fill the gas, but we don't wash windows here.",5
4174,"Really? Well, I guess I have to get used to it.",6
4175,"Mary, it's good to see you!",4
4176,Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by.,4
4177,I am so glad that you decided to stop by!,4
4178,"Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you.",4
4179,"Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink?",4
4180,"Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty.",0
4181,How about a little snack then?,4
4182,"No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago.",0
4183,"Well then, how is your family?",0
4184,Everyone is doing great. My sister finally had her baby.,0
4185,Everything is now. I'm kind of sick of it.,4
4186,Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band.,0
4187,Oooh! One for each of the zeros in 2000! Wow!,4
4188,Stop making fun of me.,0
4189,So find a guy to marry and you can get one!,4
4190,I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring!,0
4191,"Oh, I see. You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys.",4
4192,I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today. And I got a job.,4
4193,Congratulation. What will you do?,4
4194,"They got me a part-time tutoring job, teaching an Australian businessman Chinese.",0
4195,That's wonderful. I want to get a part-time job too. Tell me what I should do.,4
4196,It's very simple actually. You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted. They will give you a call if any job comes up.,0
4197,Good. I'll do it.,4
4198,"Wow! What a beautiful scenic spot! It's so open. And just breathe that fresh air, you can almost taste its freshness.",4
4199,You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain.,4
4200,Wonderful! I'll often come here for mountain climbing.,4
4201,"You should. Many Guiliners, especially the old and the young, will climb mountains here in the morning.",4
4202,No wonder people say,4
4203,"Quick! Pass me your binoculars. Look at that bird... I've never seen one of those before. It's indigenous to Guiling, and an endangered species too. This is lucky!",6
4204,I didn't know you liked bird-watching.,4
4205,"I don't really. I just like wildlife, and you don't get to see too much of it in the city. This place is full of it.",4
4206,"Hide me, Yi-jun! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny!",0
4207,"Aw, that's sweet! I knew your costume would be a success.",0
4208,It's a success all right. The kids keep trying to catch me.,0
4209,"Yeah, I saw that. I thought you were playing a game with them.",0
4210,Some game! You try being tackled by ten kids at once!,0
4211,"Um, Holly? Look behind you. They're coming this way.",0
4212,"hi, Bob, I am so glad that you came.",4
4213,of course I'd come. I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends.,0
4214,yeah. It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation. It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas.,0
4215,"how time flies. But hey, how are things going with you?",0
4216,"oh, where to start? There have been ups and downs. I'm still trying to find my place in this world. It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down. How about you? You still with Jenn",0
4217,"yeah, Jenny and I got married right after graduation. It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet. I was supporting us both while she continued her studies. But now things are getting better",0
4218,"oh, that sounds wonderful. I have always known you two would make it. I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys. I don't want us to drift apart again.",4
4219,"definitely! Actually, we just moved into a new place. There's a house-warming party this Saturday, if you are free? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party.",4
4220,sounds great! I'll be there.,4
4221,"I guess I'm just a little nervous. I'm giving everything I have to invoking, and...",0
4222,"and what if it doesn't work out, right?",0
4223,Exactly.,0
4224,You need to quit thinking like a loser. invoking is going to kick butt. You know how I know?,0
4225,How?,0
4226,Because I won't let it fail.,0
4227,"But what about tomorrow? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker, and not us?",0
4228,Are you ready for the camping trip?,0
4229,"All set. I've got my makeup, my Cds, and my portable TV set...",0
4230,Hello! We're supposed to be getting back to nature.,0
4231,"Yeah, yeah. Anyway... I'm packed. Are you?",0
4232,I've been packed for a week. All my stuff is in this backpack.,0
4233,Let me see... two books... birdseed?,0
4234,That's trail mix!,0
4235,Same difference. What's this?,0
4236,I’ m fed up with marriage.,0
4237,Why do you say so? Everyone admires that you have a good wife.,0
4238,"Oh, no. When we were poor, we often tried our best to make ends meet. It was a hard time.",0
4239,But now you are rich.,0
4240,And we have some squabbles on some boring things.,0
4241,This is ordinary marriage life.,0
4242,"Margaret, do you think I should enroll in the science course?",0
4243,"Yes, I think so, If you want to graduated this year, you've got to take a science course.",0
4244,"Right, I figure since you are doing premedical, you know about the very courses.",0
4245,"Well, I have to take biology, chemistry, maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.",0
4246,"Yes, I really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.",0
4247,That's a problem.,0
4248,What are you listening to? Is that Beethoven or Mozart?,0
4249,It's Beethoven. Do you like it?,0
4250,"I think Beethoven's music is incredible. I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent, too. Do you believe that?",0
4251,"I don't know about that, but I do think that it helps people relax.",0
4252,What other kind of music do you listen to?,0
4253,"Actually, I mostly just listen classical music. What about you?",0
4254,"To be honest, I think classical music is too complicated for me.",0
4255,What kind of music do you prefer then?,0
4256,I like pop music. Do you?,0
4257,Not really. I don't think pop music has much depth.,0
4258,I see what you mean. I think that's way I like it so much.,0
4259,"How long have you been in to pop music, then?",0
4260,I've always been into it. Have you always liked classical music?,0
4261,"Not really. When I was little, we didn't really listen to music at all.",0
4262,"So, how did you become interested in it?",0
4263,"Well, when I was about 10 years old, I started playing the piano. I think that's how it all started.",0
4264,Do you still play piano?,0
4265,"Yes, it's one of my hobbies.",0
4266,"Hi Paul. How are you, friend.",0
4267,Not good. My cousin is driving me up the wall.,2
4268,How so?,0
4269,"He stays up untill all hours of the night, and he never lifts a finger to help.",2
4270,Have you talk to him about it?,0
4271,"Not yet, but I have to soon. He's eating me out of house and home. I caught him reading the fridge again last night",2
4272,"Ahahah, Maybe that will help you lose weight.",0
4273,"This is no laughing matter, Nick.",0
4274,Sorry Paul. I couldn't help it. So why doesn't he give you a hand?,0
4275,He watch the tob too much. Now really I don't know. But I can't handle this much longer.,0
4276,"Well, talk to him, and let me know what happens, OK?",0
4277,"You're from New York, aren't you?",0
4278,"Yes, that's right.",0
4279,What do you suggest I should see in New York?,0
4280,"Well, how about the Museum of Modern Art?",0
4281,"No, I don't like museums. They're boring.",0
4282,Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building?,0
4283,Ah! That sounds interesting.,4
4284,What's your favorite book?,0
4285,It's Gone With the Wind.,0
4286,Why do you like it best?,0
4287,I enjoy the various characters and the plot.,4
4288,Well. I like the Thom Birds best.,0
4289,Is it very interesting?,0
4290,"Sure. I like the writer's language, too.",0
4291,"If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book.",0
4292,Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?,4
4293,That's a good idea. Let's go!,4
4294,Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller?,0
4295,Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?,0
4296,"Yes, but I have never taken his class before.",0
4297,He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?,0
4298,"Yes, that's what I need.",0
4299,He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you willing to study hard?,0
4300,"Yes, I guess so.",0
4301,What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?,0
4302,"Yes, I had a teacher like that before.",0
4303,Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?,0
4304,"No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing.",0
4305,"Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good luck!",4
4306,"Honey, what's wrong with you?",0
4307,I'm not feeling well. I'm very nervous.,0
4308,Take it easy. We are going to have our own baby. You should be happy.,0
4309,"Yeah, I know.",0
4310,"The doctors and the nurses will help you. And I will be waiting for you right here, praying for you and our baby.",0
4311,"Thank you, dear. I feel better now.",4
4312,The weather is terrible.,0
4313,Yeah. It's been raining a lot these days.,0
4314,I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain.,0
4315,Have you heard when it's supposed to get better?,0
4316,"I saw the weather report, and it's going to rain for the next eight days.",0
4317,That sucks so much. What are we going to do?,0
4318,I'm getting pretty bored. We should do something despite the rain.,0
4319,I'm with you. What do you have in mind?,0
4320,I haven't been to the Mall in a long time. Let's go there.,0
4321,"That sounds good. They have a movie theatre there, so if we get bored, we can watch a movie.",4
4322,Great. I'll stop by your place now.,4
4323,Ok. Don't forget to bring your umbrella. The rain can start up again anytime.,4
4324,"Come in, come in, what can I do for you?",0
4325,"Professor Donald, are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester?",0
4326,"Yes, I am applying on it.",0
4327,"I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior, but...",0
4328,Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.,0
4329,"I know, but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.",0
4330,"Well, if you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.",0
4331,"Oh, thanks, professor Donald. This is really very nice of you.",4
4332,"... so, I said, let’ s take a break.And since that night, I’ Ve been waiting for him to call, but I still haven’ t heard from him. You don’ t think he’ s seeing someone else, do you?",0
4333,"Come on, don’ t be so dramatic! I’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine.",0
4334,"You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me? I’ m sure he’ s cheating on me! Why else wouldn’ t he call?",1
4335,"But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can do whatever he likes.",0
4336,He’ s the love of my life! I’ Ve really messed this up.,5
4337,"Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It’ s going to be alright.",0
4338,"But I... I still love him! And it’ s all my fault! I can’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter, it’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I’ Ve totally messed this up!",5
4339,"You know what, Veronica, I think you should make the first step. I’ m sure he’ ll forgive you...",0
4340,"No, this is not gonna happen! I... I’ Ve ruined everything...",5
4341,do you hear something?,0
4342,"what's wrong, Jerry? You look so upset.",0
4343,"to be honest, I was just dumped.",5
4344,"oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You can go on a holiday to cheer you up.",0
4345,"no, thanks. I'm not in the mood for traveling.",5
4346,come on. A trip will do you good. Are you doing anything this weekend?,0
4347,I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing.,0
4348,"well, my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday. Do you want to come with us?",0
4349,where is that?,0
4350,not very far from here. We'll fly. It's about one and a half hours.,0
4351,what's there to see?,0
4352,"there is a large canyon, vast grasslands, ancient forests and mountain lakes.",0
4353,"oh, sounds nice.",4
4354,"yes, the scenery there is breathtaking. I have some pictures at home. You can come over and take a look if you like.",0
4355,ok. Then I can make up my mind.,4
4356,Do you want to hang out tomorrow?,0
4357,"Oh, I can't. I have a date!",0
4358,Really? Wow with who?,6
4359,This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months. She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.,0
4360,"Wait a minute, you mean you met her online?",0
4361,"Yeah! I signed up for a website called match @. com and it is great! You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets. Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.",0
4362,That is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like that?,0
4363,"It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.",0
4364,I guess it does seem logical. I'll have to check it out!,0
4365,"Well, I'm afraid I must be going now. I have no idea it was so late.",0
4366,Stay for dinner with us.,4
4367,"I'm afraid I can't. I have a dinner party at seven tonight. You see, I am going to England the day after tomorrow.",0
4368,"Well, I won't keep you then. It was very nice of you to come to see me.",4
4369,It has been a pleasure. Goodbye.,4
4370,Goodbye. Thank you again for coming.,4
4371,"Honey, do you have a second?",0
4372,Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried.What’ s on your mind?,0
4373,We need to talk.,0
4374,Okay...,0
4375,"I’ Ve been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.",0
4376,"What? Why? I mean, we’ Ve had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we’ re happy together, aren’ t we?",6
4377,"That’ s just it, I’ m not happy anymore, Tim. It’ s not you, it’ s me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!",5
4378,"So, what are you saying? You’ re breaking up with me because I’ m perfect?",6
4379,"Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ ll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I’ d only hurt you, I know I’ d only make you cry.",5
4380,"Baby, come on. Don’ t do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don’ t leave me.",5
4381,"I can’ t, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I’ m only doing this for you. I don’ t really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.",5
4382,Laura...,5
4383,"Here are your keys. I’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I’ m sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I’ ll always love you. Goodbye.",5
4384,"Oh, my God. I can't take it any more.",0
4385,"What's wrong, honey? Take it easy.",0
4386,I am tired of doing that boring work. I just repeat doing counting everyday. It's so terrible.,0
4387,Me too. But I think we can do something else for a change.,0
4388,You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion. Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is?,0
4389,But you did a good job. You always perform the best in our company.,0
4390,"Yes, that's in the past. Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help.",0
4391,Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation.,0
4392,I was full of ambitions before. But now I have no aim for my career.,0
4393,Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting.,0
4394,That sounds interesting. But I don't know how to do that.,0
4395,How about a training course?,0
4396,A training course? That must be costly.,0
4397,But it's worth it. Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future.,0
4398,"OK, let's have a try.",0
4399,OK.,0
4400,Have you seen the new James Bond movie?,0
4401,"Oh, yes. You?",0
4402,Yes. What did you think of it?,0
4403,I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it. What did you think of it?,4
4404,"Yes, I liked it, too. It was exciting, but not over the top. Do you know what I mean?",4
4405,"Mmm. That's what I thought too. I really liked the car chase, and the opening credit sequence was very exciting. And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan.",4
4406,"Oh, yes. He's brilliant. Did you like the title song?",0
4407,"Not as much as last time, actually. What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role?",0
4408,"Hum, Edward Norton, or something like that. Did you like him?",0
4409,"Yes. He was excellent. They worked well together, don't you think?",4
4410,I don't know. I think the woman was better. She provided a good love interest. Lucky James Bond!,4
4411,Yes!,4
4412,Where are you going?,0
4413,I'm going to buy a CD.,0
4414,Why not listen to music online?,0
4415,"Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line, isn't it?",0
4416,"You can audition music on line, and you can audition it off line after downloading it, so you needn't pay for it.",0
4417,"I have downloaded one, but it still can't be listened.",0
4418,"In order to listen to music, you must have the necessary software.",0
4419,Can you recommend some to me?,0
4420,Certainly. Realplayer is a good.,0
4421,Can I download it?,0
4422,"Yes, but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it.",0
4423,I'll try it tonight.,0
4424,What were you and Richard talking about earlier? It looked intense.,0
4425,"Yeah, Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate.",0
4426,"Oh, no. I know how insensitive he can be. What has he done now?",0
4427,He asked me how long it took me to learn English.,0
4428,"But, you were born and raised in California!",6
4429,"Yeah, but I get that sometimes. It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U. S., we'll always be foreigners in their eyes.",0
4430,What a racist! How can you stand working with the guy?,6
4431,"You know, Richard isn't such a bad guy. He made the comment out of ignorance, not malice.",0
4432,"So, what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English?",0
4433,"I told him 28 years. And, he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week. He was puzzled for a minute, and then he got it.",0
4434,Are you sure he really got the message?,0
4435,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English.",0
4436,That's hilarious! What did he say?,0
4437,"He said, ' 36 years, ' and we both laughed about it. He apologized and now, it's all good.",0
4438,I'm glad. I bet he won't make that mistake again.,0
4439,What can I do for you today?,0
4440,I would like to use a computer.,0
4441,Do you have your library card?,0
4442,I sure do.,0
4443,There is a wait for the computers.,0
4444,That’ s all right.,0
4445,You need to print your name on this list.,0
4446,Okay. Now what?,0
4447,"Once a computer is available, I will let you know.",0
4448,How am I supposed to log on to the computer?,0
4449,All you do is type in the number on the back of your card.,0
4450,That’ s it? Thank you very much.,4
4451,"how are you doing, Christopher?",0
4452,"to be honest, I'm really fed up with work at the moment. I need a break!",2
4453,are you doing anything this weekend?,0
4454,I have to work on Saturday all day! I really hate my job!,2
4455,are you available on Sunday?,0
4456,"yes, that's my only day off until Thursday.",0
4457,"ok, well, my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday. We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere, so you could still sleep in. Do you want to come with us?",0
4458,that'd be fantastic! Which beach are you going to?,0
4459,it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city.,0
4460,what should I bring with me?,0
4461,"we've got plenty of inflatables, but if you want to sit on a chair, you'll have to bring your own sunlounger.",0
4462,I can just use my beach towel. I love lazing around in the sun.,0
4463,do you like surfing?,0
4464,I've actually never tired. Do you have a surfboard?,0
4465,we've got a few. I can teach you how to surf on Sunday. It'll be fun!,4
4466,I can't wait! It sounds like we're going to have a great time. How much money should I bring?,0
4467,"you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money. My friend is driving, so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money.",0
4468,"ok, where and when should I meet you?",0
4469,we'll pick you up at your place at noon. Be there or be square!,4
4470,"Excuse me, I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city.",0
4471,"OK, please.",4
4472,"My wife wants to take the children to go shopping, where is the best place to go?",4
4473,"I would recommend the mall, it's about 20 minutes, drive to the south in a taxi. It has a wide range of shops and restaurants.",4
4474,"Thank you. Also, we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town. Can you recommend some local attractions?",4
4475,How old are your children?,0
4476,I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl.,0
4477,I would recommend a day at the zoo. It's fun for all the family. There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip.,0
4478,It sounds marvelous. Thank you for your help.,4
4479,"Boy, it looks like everyone in your family is here, from young to old.",0
4480,Easter's a good day for reunions. The family goes to church together.,0
4481,And after church they come here for lunch?,0
4482,"Yup, a big potluck buffet. And then-notice there are no children around?",0
4483,"Yeah, what's up with that?",0
4484,"The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these. Hide away, Yi-jun!",0
4485,Could you please help me to check out the book?,0
4486,"Sure, what's the author's name, please.",0
4487,I can't remember that clearly. It probably be Charles...,0
4488,Charles Dickens?,0
4489,"No, no, no. I'm not interested in literature.",0
4490,"OK, do you know the title of the book?",0
4491,"Oh, sorry. I'm always absent-minded. I remember that I've put a note in my pocket.",0
4492,"So, show me the note please.",0
4493,I can't find it now.,0
4494,"Oh, such bad luck, sir. Can you please name the category of the book?",0
4495,Let me see. It's not fiction. It's biography.,0
4496,"OK, I'll search it for you. A moment, please.",0
4497,Thanks.,0
4498,How do you decide what grade we get?,0
4499,"I look at many things, attendance, quizzes, and tests.",0
4500,What is the most important factor?,0
4501,"Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do your best from the beginning.",0
4502,How can we keep track of our grades?,0
4503,"The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework, attendance, and quizzes total 60 percent.",0
4504,What if we can't get to school?,0
4505,You can only miss one class without penalty.,0
4506,"If we have a major problem, will you let us know?",0
4507,I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.,0
4508,May I help you with something?,0
4509,I would like to return some books.,0
4510,I’ ll take them.,0
4511,Here you go.,0
4512,These books were due two weeks ago.,0
4513,Yeah. I totally forgot they were due.,0
4514,You will need to pay late fees on these books.,0
4515,How much are the late fees?,0
4516,The fee is 25 cents every day.,0
4517,I have to pay 25 cents a day?,6
4518,And that’ s for each book that is late.,0
4519,That shouldn’ t be a problem.,0
4520,This is such a beautiful day! Great for sailing!,4
4521,It sure is! The water looks so nice! Anchor the boat for a little while. I’ m going to take a dip.,4
4522,Why are you doggy-paddling? I taught you how to swim! Do your breast stroke!,4
4523,"I get too tired! I’ ll just backstroke, it’ s easier!",0
4524,Try kicking your legs more. That’ s good. Don’ t go out too far!,0
4525,It’ s fine. Jump in!,0
4526,Kathy! Get back here! I see a shark!,0
4527,Ahahah!!! Help me! Help! Bring the boat closer! The shark is coming straight towards me!,0
4528,It’ s right under you! Kathy!!!,0
4529,"what was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail?",0
4530,my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate.,0
4531,three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive!,0
4532,"well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive.",0
4533,were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?,0
4534,"I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn’ t afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood.",0
4535,did your husband's family get to meet your family?,0
4536,"my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, so that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, but we agreed t",0
4537,that makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon?,0
4538,we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa.,0
4539,"you really didn't have a very traditional wedding, did you?",0
4540,"not at all, but we don’ t have a very traditional marriage either, so it suited us perfectly!",0
4541,"Oh, hi, Jessica, are you going to see this movie too?",0
4542,"I'd love to, the movies are smash hit.",0
4543,Then let's go in.,0
4544,"I can't. I'm waiting for Paul, but he's late.",0
4545,I'll say the movie's starting in the minute.,0
4546,I know. I wonder what's keeping him.,5
4547,"Looks like he won't show up. He's done this before, hasn't he?",0
4548,"Yeah, a number of times.",5
4549,What's he trying to pull anyway.,0
4550,I don't know. But this is definitely the last straw.,5
4551,Maybe you should start seeing someone else.,0
4552,"You said it. Ok, let's go in, Sandy.",4
4553,"So, you’ re applying for a B2 visa, where is your final destination and what’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States?",0
4554,I’ m going to visit my brother. he’ s just had a baby. He lives in Minneapolis.,0
4555,And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States?,0
4556,"I’ ll be here for approximately three weeks. See, here’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March.",0
4557,"And, who is sponsoring your trip?",0
4558,"My brother, here, this is an invitation letter from him. I will stay with him and his family in their home.",0
4559,"Alright, tell me about the ties you have to your home country.",0
4560,"Well, I own a house. actually, I’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors. I have a car at home, and oh, my job! I’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer. Actually, I only have three weeks’ vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.",0
4561,And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?,0
4562,"Well, I do have assets in my country. like I said, I own a house, and see, here’ s a bank statement showing my investments, and my bank balance.",4
4563,"I’ m sorry, sir, we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time, instead, you are granted a resident visa! Congratulations, you are the millionth person to apply for a visa! You win! Congratulations!",4
4564,"Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?",0
4565,"Well, I am a bit out of shape. I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit.",0
4566,"Oh, that's good news for us.",4
4567,So what do you provide?,0
4568,"First of all, we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits.",0
4569,How can you get that done?,0
4570,"Well, we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified. And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs.",0
4571,What else?,0
4572,"Since everyone is different, your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal.",0
4573,Sounds pretty good. What about the charge?,4
4574,"That depends. We offer membership for one month, half a year and one year.",0
4575,Maybe one month. Just have a try first. Not too tough at the beginning.,0
4576,Wise decision. You'll find it's totally worth it.,4
4577,Hi. What's your name?,0
4578,My name is Jung Min. What's your name?,0
4579,My name is Jessica. It's nice to meet you.,0
4580,Yes. It's nice to meet you too. Are you a new student too?,0
4581,No. I'm a sophomore. I take it you are a new student?,0
4582,Yeah. It's pretty exciting to be here.,0
4583,Have fun while it lasts. The excitement wears off real quick. Especially after you see how much homework you get. Where are you from?,0
4584,"I'm from Korea. My parents wanted me to go to an American university, so I came here.",0
4585,"I have never been to Korea. I've been to Japan before, but never Korea.",0
4586,Why were you in Japan?,0
4587,My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country. He's so into learning about different cultures.,0
4588,That's pretty cool.,4
4589,I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents.,0
4590,"Well, if you ever want to visit Korea, I would be happy to show you around.",0
4591,"Thanks for the offer. I'll keep that in mind. Oh, the professor is coming. We'll talk more after class.",4
4592,Ok.,0
4593,Guess who I saw just now?,0
4594,Who?,0
4595,"John Smith, the escaped criminal.",0
4596,"That bad egg, who took the low road since he was a boy.",2
4597,I think I must report to the cops.,0
4598,Ok.,0
4599,What do you think of this one?,0
4600,"Eh, so so.",0
4601,And this one? Too flashy?,0
4602,"Nah, not too flashy.",0
4603,Hug! And this sweater from my aunt? Isn’ t it hideous?,0
4604,I guess.,0
4605,Are you even listening? I’ m trying to have a conversation with you.,0
4606,"And I’ m trying to watch the game, but you’ re yapping on about your new clothes!",1
4607,Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon!,1
4608,Well could you do me the favor of making this quick? It’ s the third quarter and you’ Ve been blabbering on since the first!,1
4609,"Oh, your precious game. You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!",1
4610,"Oh no you didn’ t. You didn’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals, did you? Why don’ t you just. just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?",1
4611,I might just! Enjoy your stupid game!,1
4612,Hello. Nice to see you again. I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery. I hope everything’ s OK.,0
4613,"Yes, fine. I had something wrong with my stomach. I won’ t go into detail, but it wasn’ t serious.",0
4614,I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital.,0
4615,"I think most people are a little nervous about it. I was really very, very nervous just before I had the operation, but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation.",0
4616,It must have really hurt afterwards.,0
4617,"Well, the nurse game me plenty of painkillers, but it did feel uncomfortable. I wasn’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours. That was the worse thing.",0
4618,I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital.,0
4619,"I certainly was! However, the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn’ t eat for another 72 hours, and steak was on the list!",0
4620,Is there any pain now?,0
4621,"No, not at all. I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days.",0
4622,Did they take good care of you in the hospital?,0
4623,"Oh, yes. The nurse were very kind, though they were strict about what I could drink. In the end, I just drank water and nothing else. Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay.",0
4624,"Hi, Monica, how is everything going?",0
4625,"Everything goes well, but I am thinking about quitting my current job.",0
4626,Why? You’ re not satisfied anymore?,6
4627,"I just sense. But I cannot grow anymore. My boss is not really supporting me. I am interested in some positions in other JV companies, but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out.",0
4628,That is important. Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application.,4
4629,"Certainly, it is very nice talking with you. But I really have to go now. Catch you later.",4
4630,"Ok, good luck to you.",4
4631,"Hello, is that Cathy speaking?",0
4632,"Yes, is that you, Allen?",0
4633,"Yes, how are you doing?",0
4634,Not bad.,4
4635,Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me?,4
4636,Sure.Thank you very much.,4
4637,Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK?,4
4638,"Ok, see you.",4
4639,See you.,4
4640,"Hi, Mr. Smith. what's new?",0
4641,"Nothing particular. But,...",0
4642,What's the matter?,0
4643,"I, I don't know how to explain it to you.",0
4644,"Go ahead. It's nothing serious. We are good friends, aren't we?",0
4645,"Yes, of course. But I'm afraid I can't tell you.",0
4646,"Hey, what's new?",0
4647,Not much. Just sitting here eating some Chinese food. Is that the paper? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope?,0
4648,"Ok, wait a minute... let's see. I'm a Taurus, and it says, Mars is in the third house, and is soon to eclipse Venus. I don't know what that means, but then it says, Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking. Remember to be positive. Sounds good to me.",0
4649,What about Gemini? What's the prediction?,0
4650,"Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter, your fortunes are falling. Bad luck will follow you today, and you will lose that which you value. Be careful.",0
4651,"That sounds bad! I'm really worried, what should I do? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day.",0
4652,But we have a date tonight! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope.,0
4653,Are you free tomorrow night?,0
4654,"Yes, I am.",0
4655,Shall we have dinner together?,4
4656,Do you have a special restaurant in mind?,4
4657,"Yes, I do. I know a place that has excellent food.",4
4658,OK. I'll be happy to join you.,4
4659,"Brian, do you know how to speak English?",0
4660,Yes.,0
4661,Where did you learn?,0
4662,I learned in college.,0
4663,You speak really well.,4
4664,Thank you.,4
4665,How long have you been in the U. S.?,0
4666,3 weeks.,0
4667,Is your wife with you?,0
4668,"Yes, she just got here yesterday.",0
4669,Have you been to California before?,0
4670,No. I've never been there.,0
4671,Have you ever been to Las Vegas?,0
4672,Yes. I went there once on a business trip.,0
4673,How are the children doing at sport?,0
4674,I’ m very pleased with their performances. Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds. That’ s very fast for a kid his age.,0
4675,"He’ s not very good at the long jump though, is he?",0
4676,"He’ s not bad. He can jump a distance of over four meters. I think he just prefers running to jumping. Jimmy’ s very good at the high jump. He can jump over two meters. Again, that’ s fine for someone his age.",0
4677,Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running?,0
4678,The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes.,0
4679,How are they at swimming?,0
4680,"They’ re ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They’ re not very fast, but that’ s ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape.",0
4681,Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.,0
4682,I’ d be afraid to jump from that height!,3
4683,"I think that these kinds haven’ t learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, but she soon wanted to go higher.",0
4684,"It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster, higher and further.",0
4685,"Hi, Mary. I haven't seen you in ages! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th, the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games. Is it true?",4
4686,"Yes, it is. We've been dating for over 7 years. We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th, 2008 is a red-letter day.",4
4687,Good for you! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time.,4
4688,"Yes, there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos, wedding dress, catering, transport, hotel, etc...",4
4689,Is everything ready now?,4
4690,"Almost. The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel. As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married, it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive.",4
4691,Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job.,4
4692,"Yes, we called, but it is booked up. The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet.",4
4693,"It's an excellent hotel. A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect, though very expensive.",4
4694,That's why we want to have a look at other hotels. We don’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception.,4
4695,I guess you're right. I can help you ask other hotels. I am sure there are probably some available.,4
4696,Thank you.,4
4697,My pleasure.,4
4698,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?,1
4699,"Sorry, I thought you knew.",0
4700,But you should have told me you were in love with her.,1
4701,Didn't I?,0
4702,You know you didn't.,1
4703,"Well, I'm telling you now.",0
4704,"Yes, but you might have told me before.",1
4705,I didn't think you'd be interested.,0
4706,You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?,1
4707,"Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.",0
4708,"Oh, you men! You're all the same.",1
4709,How’ s it going?,0
4710,I’ m fine. Thank you.,0
4711,Do you need anything?,0
4712,I need you to help me.,0
4713,What can I do for you?,0
4714,I am looking for an article in a newspaper.,0
4715,Did you check the periodicals?,0
4716,I didn’ t even bother to think of that.,0
4717,I’ ll show you where to find your article.,0
4718,I get lost in this library.,0
4719,It’ s right this way.,0
4720,Thanks a lot for your help.,4
4721,"Hi, Helen! how is it going?",0
4722,I'm very busy these days. It seems I can never finish my work.,0
4723,"Well, take it easy! Don't let it get on top of you.",0
4724,I'll try. I'm under a lot of pressure right now.,5
4725,Why don't you take a few days off?,0
4726,I can't. I am really behind of my work.,5
4727,Can you speak Japanese?,0
4728,"Yes, I can, but not very well.",0
4729,Where did you learn it?,0
4730,At school. And I'm still learning it now.,0
4731,How long have you been learning it?,0
4732,About three years.,0
4733,Can you speak any other languages?,0
4734,I'm afraid not.,0
4735,I'm too tired now. I've already worked for 12 hours overtime!,2
4736,God! Don't you think they should get you an assistant?,0
4737,"Yes, they were supposed to, but so far nobody's turned up, and I have to do the work alone. This is the first break I've had all day.",0
4738,They're really running you into the ground. Why don't you ask for some time off? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest.,0
4739,I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project.,0
4740,You'd better pay more attention to your health.,0
4741,"I will, thanks for your concern.",4
4742,You're welcome.,4
4743,It is too bad today.,0
4744,What happened?,0
4745,"My som was lost. I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping, but he ignored it.",0
4746,How did you find him at last?,0
4747,It was the police wo helped me to do that.,0
4748,It must have taught you a lesson this time.,0
4749,"Morning, Peter. Nice suit! A new one?",4
4750,"Oh, yes. My wife bought it for me yesterday. Hmm, you look nice in that yellow dress. Yellow suits you really well.",4
4751,Maybe. Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes. They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion.,0
4752,"That's right. You know, pink, green and black could also be good for you. Actually, I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion. It's just that different colors can give people different impressions. For example, black could make you look mature, while pink could make you look young and energetic.",4
4753,Thank you for your compliments. It sounds like you're a clothing expert.,4
4754,"Well, compared with my wife, I'm just a beginner.",4
4755,Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?,0
4756,What? Why do we have to do that?,0
4757,"Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.",0
4758,"I see. That’ s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!",0
4759,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich!",0
4760,"That’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’ s like we went back in time!",0
4761,I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight. How about you?,0
4762,"Yes, I ‘ d love to. it’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good.",4
4763,"I like watching it for the fashion. I like to see what the ladies are wearing. Of course, the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo.",0
4764,Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours. Which films do you think will win awards this year?,0
4765,"I ‘ m really not sure. Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony, but this year there are several contenders.",0
4766,You’ re right. This year should be much more exciting than usual. What’ s you favourite award category?,0
4767,"You might think this strange, but I like the category for best foreign language film.",0
4768,It’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood. I like the best actor and actress.,4
4769,How do you celebrate national day in your country?,0
4770,There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building.,0
4771,What kinds of parades are there?,0
4772,"The parades are usually military ones, but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs. What do you do on national day in your country?",0
4773,We don’ t have a national day.,0
4774,Really? That’ s unusual.,6
4775,"I guess it is. Most countries have on, but we don’ t.",0
4776,"Actually, even though we have parades, most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping. In the evening, many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day.",0
4777,"Hi Melissa, are you going home this weekend?",0
4778,"No, not this weekend. I have too much work to do.",0
4779,Where do your parents live?,0
4780,My father lives in Washington DC.,0
4781,How about your mother?,0
4782,My mother died two years ago.,0
4783,"Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Is your father still working?",0
4784,"No, he's retired.",0
4785,Do you have any family here?,0
4786,"Yes, two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here.",0
4787,Do you have any brothers or sisters?,0
4788,"Yes, I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston.",0
4789,Do you see them a lot?,0
4790,Not as much as I'd like to. Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.,0
4791,"What happened, John?",0
4792,Nothing.,0
4793,Why do you look unhappy?,0
4794,I’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off.,0
4795,"Oh, cheer up. He’ ll understand you.",0
4796,I hope so.,0
4797,"Hi, Tina, I’ Ve got good news. I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company. They informed me to go to the final round next Monday. It looks very promising.",4
4798,That is awesome. Congratulation! I know you can make it.,4
4799,Thanks. Let’ s go for a celebration this evening. Are you free?,0
4800,"Yes. Wait for me at the cafe down my office building. See 5PM, ok?",0
4801,No problem. See you!,4
4802,See you!,4
4803,Do you like ethnic food?,0
4804,"I do! My favorites are Mexican, Thai, and Indian.",4
4805,Really? Have you ever tried Moroccan?,6
4806,I can't say that I have. What are the basic ingredients?,0
4807,I don't know. A friend of mine said I should try it.,0
4808,Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is?,0
4809,"As a matter of fact, he gave me this address.",0
4810,Let's go there for lunch! I'm up for an adventure!,4
4811,"Nicole, your Fettucini is very... unique.",0
4812,"But not as good as your mother's, right?",0
4813,"Actually, it's better...",0
4814,What? Are you kidding?,6
4815,No. It was the only dish she wasn't good at. So we could use you as the new head chef...,0
4816,"Oh, Uncle Giovanni. That's wonderful! Thank you! Thank you!",4
4817,"OK, OK. Get back to work. There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen...",4
4818,Mary and Tom are breaking up.,0
4819,It's unbelievable! They are only married for one month. Then who is at fault?,6
4820,"Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom, for he fell in love with another woman.",0
4821,Do you think they'll become reconciled?,0
4822,"No, I don't think so. She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage.",0
4823,What a shame! Their marriage is really a mistake.,0
4824,have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast?,0
4825,sure. Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality.,0
4826,"as far as you could see, is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland?",0
4827,"to begin with, I have to use chopsticks.",0
4828,but you look quite proficient in using them now.,0
4829,"certainly. After all, I've been here for two years. It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils. Though, I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch",0
4830,"yes, table etiquette. There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm i",0
4831,anything strang about that?,0
4832,"maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate. They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices. It's very inauspicious, and might enrage all present.",0
4833,"oh, sorry! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks.",0
4834,I hate to go outside.,2
4835,Me too.,2
4836,Why do you hate to go outside?,0
4837,I meet too many jerks.,2
4838,I agree.,2
4839,This city is full of jerks.,2
4840,Rude people are everywhere.,2
4841,But what can you do?,0
4842,You can yell at them.,2
4843,And they will yell back at you.,2
4844,Yelling doesn't do any good.,0
4845,No. The best thing to do is just stay home.,0
4846,Good morning.,0
4847,Good morning.,0
4848,What does the paper say?,0
4849,Nothing much — the same old stuff. A lot of bad news as usual.,0
4850,"Well, what’ s the weather report?",0
4851,"Sunny and mild today, cloudy and rainy tomorrow.",0
4852,Did they find those bank robbers?,0
4853,"Not yet. They were holding two men in Ohio, but they let them go. They weren’ t the criminals after all.",0
4854,What about the sports page? What were the scores of last night’ s games?,0
4855,Here’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself.,0
4856,I hate computer games.,2
4857,Why? They are fine.,0
4858,Because they are too violent. Some of them are even disgusting.,2
4859,Indeed there are bad games. But many of them are good.,0
4860,"If boys grow up with computer games, they will surely become bad.",2
4861,Come on. Things are not so bad. Boys can learn to use the computer through games.,0
4862,"Are you free this weekend, Miss Rose?",0
4863,"Yes, I am. What's up?",0
4864,Then would you please go to a dance party with me?,4
4865,With pleasure. I suppose you dance often.,4
4866,"Oh, no. As a matter of fact, I haven't danced for a long time.",4
4867,But I am told that you dance wonderfully well.,4
4868,"Thanks for flattering me. I think you dance a lot, right?",4
4869,No. Just occasionally.,0
4870,What's your favorite dance?,0
4871,"It's hard to say, but I do love the foxtrot and waltz.",0
4872,How about rock'n'roll?,0
4873,"To tell you the truth, I don't like it. It's too noisy.",0
4874,And the tango?,0
4875,"Oh, it's really beautiful, but I just can't do it well.",0
4876,Don't be so modest. I'm sure you can do it very well. Then I'll meet you at six. Is that at all right?,4
4877,OK.,4
4878,Great! I'm your lucky fellow then.,4
4879,"You are an outgoing person, quite easy to talk with.",4
4880,"Yes, my friends like to get along with me well.",4
4881,Do you have many friends?,4
4882,"Yes, I like to make new friends.",4
4883,What do you usually do with them?,4
4884,"We like to get together, chat and enjoy beautiful music.",4
4885,"I feel like going for a drink, it's been a long day.",0
4886,"Great idea! Peter, I could use the drink.",4
4887,How about the new bar across the road?,4
4888,Sounds good. The food there is fantastic too.,4
4889,"I agree, I had lunch there last week.",4
4890,Excellent! That sounds like a plan.,4
4891,"Hello, are you Chinese?",0
4892,"No, I'm Korean. Where are you from?",0
4893,I'm from America. Are you settling in all right?,0
4894,I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable. What about you?,0
4895,I live in my uncle's house. He came here ten years ago.,0
4896,What do you think of the local accent here? Has it been causing you any problems?,0
4897,I think it's just a matter of getting used to it.,0
4898,I can't agree more.,0
4899,Why don't you watch where you're going?,1
4900,Me? You're the one who pulled out in front of me!,0
4901,There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in.,1
4902,"Hey, listen. I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow, you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me.",0
4903,I think my arm is broken.,0
4904,"Sorry about your arm, but it serves you right. You need to learn how to drive. You're lucky you didn't get killed. And I'm lucky to be alive too.",0
4905,"Listen, let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was.",0
4906,Fine with me. I know the laws of the road. I'm not worried.,0
4907,"I have a cell phone in my car. Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me, and then I can call the police?",0
4908,Alright.,0
4909,It doesn't work. It looks like it's broken. I need to get to a hospital. You should drive me there.,1
4910,"Oh, yeah? It's better if we make a police report first. Then you can go to the hospital.",0
4911,Damn it! I'm injured here. We could wait all day for the police.,1
4912,"Well, you'll just have to wait. I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive. I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone. Don't worry. You'll get to the hospital in time.",0
4913,It really hurts.,1
4914,"Yes, maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now, you will have to get used to a little physical pain. You know what I mean?",0
4915,To hell with you. The accident was your fault.,1
4916,"I'm afraid it wasn't. And when the police get here, you will also see that it wasn't. But enough of this bickering. I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone. Alright?",0
4917,To hell with you.,1
4918,"Bill, do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today?",0
4919,Yes. They were open this morning when I came to work. They must've finished remodeling. Why do you want to know?,0
4920,"Well, I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today. That is, if you haven't promised to go with someone else.",0
4921,"That'd be wonderful, Peter. But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning.",4
4922,I'm sorry I was such a grouch. It must've been the weather. When it rains I get depressed.,0
4923,Forget it. I'll see you at 11:30 am.,4
4924,Sorry. I didn't mean to be late. Can I come in?,0
4925,What's your excuse this time?,0
4926,Have I used the one that my sister is sick?,0
4927,"Yes, twice last week.",0
4928,Are you sure? I thought I said it was my mother.,0
4929,I don't think so. But it could've been.,0
4930,Well. You can trust me this time. My sister is definitely sick. I'm just coming from the hospital. They say she might even die.,0
4931,"I don't buy your story. Try not to have any more sick relatives this week, all right?",2
4932,I'll do my best.,0
4933,Just try to be a little more punctual in the future.,0
4934,I'm working on it. Really!,0
4935,"Hi, Becky, what's up?",0
4936,"Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall.",0
4937,What's the problem?,0
4938,She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she ' s around.,0
4939,For example?,0
4940,"Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her.",0
4941,"No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.",0
4942,It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids.,0
4943,"My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.",0
4944,"Hi, Alice, what are you doing this sunday?",0
4945,"Nothing really, why, what ' s up?",0
4946,"If you are free, maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party. It will be fun, you will get to know lots of people.",0
4947,"Sounds great, I'd very much like to accept your invitation, thanks, when?",4
4948,Around six pm.,0
4949,Do you need help setting up or anything? I don't mind. I like to do that kind of thing. It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating.,0
4950,"No. thank you. I can handle it, but thanks for the offer.",0
4951,"Ok, I will see you then.",0
4952,"Great, have a good day, thanks again for the offer.",4

4957,What’ s the time?,0
4958,"Six thirty, tonight.",0
4959,"Oh, I’ m sorry I can’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you",0
4960,All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye!,0
4961,Good bye!,0
4962,"David, I’ m going to China.",0
4963,Really? How did you get the chance?,6

4970,"Thank you, David.",4
4971,Did you watch the final last night? My favorite singer won!,4
4972,"Oh, I love him too. He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest.",4
4973,"Yeah, he got booted after his initial performance in the audition, but he did not give up. He then tried at another two auditions.",4
4974,"He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest. Fortunately, in the third audition, he has won popularity among the audience. And that's when I started to notice him.",4
4975,Me too.,4
4976,"Before he made the top three, I was so nervous. I just fear that he might be knocked out.",4
4977,"Yeah, there're so many excellent candidates out there. Who knows which one will make it to the final?",4
4978,"Absolutely. That's why when he entered the final, I was so excited.",4
4979,"He really did a great job in the finale, especially in the PK round. He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him.",4
4980,And the host announced that he won it all!,4
4981,"Come in, come in!",0
4982,"Hi, Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn’ t you meet me there?",0
4983,I thought we were supposed to meet here.,0
4984,Don’ t you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn’ t make sense to meet at the apartment.,0
4985,I’ m sorry. We must have misunderstood each other.,0
4986,Why don’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions?,0
4987,You’ re right. I am sorry. Let’ s go and watch the movie.,0
4988,It’ s okay. I don’ t want to go now. We’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie. I don’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning.,0

4994,The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library.,0
4995,Where is the library?,0

5004,When is it?,0
5005,It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.,0
5006,Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals?,0
5007,"OK. The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan. On that day, people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river.",0
5008,Why do people eat rice cakes on that day?,0

5018,"If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone.",0
5019,Sure. I can come over. What should we do?,0
5020,How about if we watch a comedy. I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense.,0
5021,Ok. I'll get ready and leave. I'll see you in about 20 minutes.,0
5022,"Hurry, ok. It's dark out.",0

5029,what do you usually write about?,0
5030,"at first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an",0
5031,that's interesting. How often do you write a blog?,0
5032,"it's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, and if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks.",0
5033,got it. Are you still updating your blog?,0
5034,"sure, since I came back from the US, I've been keeping the habit of blogging, simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like.",0

5036,Have you found a new job yet?,0
5037,"No, not yet. I’ m still looking. I’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though.",0

5047,"This is all too fast. He's my best friend, and now he's gone.",5

5050,That way they look longer.,0
5051,Now what are you doing?,0
5052,Putting on mascara.,0
5053,Nasty. You'd better not rub your eyes.,2
5054,I won't.,0
5055,And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face.,0
5056,Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere?,0

5070,"Well, I've invited them for brunch.",0
5071,"Hmm, I must be getting absent-minded.",0

5073,"hey, Isabelle...",0
5074,Logan! Why on earth are you hiding here? White hat! Come on! Don't tell me you're the guy! It can't be true.,1

5081,OK. Then tell me what else you know.,0
5082,Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make. Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth?,0
5083,"He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film, incredible stunts. By the way, can you count the breaks?",0
5084,"Sure. His skull, his eyes, his nose, three times, his jaw, his shoul-der, is chest, two fingers, a knee. As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet! '",0
5085,Indeed you know much about him.,0
5086,This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world.,0
5087,Are you ready to go shopping?,0
5088,Not yet. I'm not finished with my research yet.,0
5089,What research?,0
5090,Reading my fashion magazines! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends?,0
5091,But they're just ads.,0
5092,"Duh... That's the point. The people in the ads are wearing what's in. Plus, there are articles on new trends.",0
5093,Is there anything worth watching on another channel?,0
5094,I think there’ s a Western on.,0
5095,Do you mind if we watch it. I’ d really like to see it.,0

5109,Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures?,0
5110,"Sure, we wouldn't miss it for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour.",4
5111,You were lucky then. What did you do after that?,4
5112,We went for a swim in the sea. That was the best part of the day. Just look at my nice tan.,4
5113,So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday.,4
5114,"Yes, you're right. And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back. My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday.",4
5115,Here's the course description guide.,0
5116,What do I do with it?,0
5117,Do you want me to help you?,0
5118,Please.,0
5119,Look. Here are the core classes. Everyone has to take them.,0

5123,Good. Now you can pick classes by yourself.,0
5124,"Ann, do you have time next Monday?",0
5125,"Yeah, what’ s up?",0
5126,"Next Monday is my birthday, and I would like you to attend my party.",4
5127,Wow. I'd love to.,4
5128,Great!,4
5129,When and where?,4
5130,"Five o’ clock that afternoon, and in my place, you know?",4
5131,"Yes, I know. I appreciate your invitation.",4
5132,I am going to invite other guys. See you that day.,4
5133,See you.,4
5134,Hey Stacy. What's going on?,0
5135,I'm pretty tired these days.,0
5136,Why? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands?,0
5137,"I have so much house work to do. I have to take care of the kids, cook, clean, laundry, and the cycle never ends.",0
5138,How about your husband. Does he help much?,0
5139,Not at all. He comes home and complains about his hard day at work. He expects me to do everything. He even wants me to feed him sometimes. Can you believe that?,0
5140,That sucks.,0
5141,"If he wasn't so lazy, I think I wouldn't have any complaints. He mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?",0
5142,That's crossing the line.,1
5143,Oh well. I'll have to live with it. What else can I do?,0
5144,Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games?,0
5145,"Of course. It's the tradition game in winter, and with good reason. Don't you like watching it?",0
5146,Of course I do. I love it. All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable.,0
5147,"That's true. For various reasons, it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics. You know, the low temperature may cause many problems.",0
5148,Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics?,0
5149,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times, only summer events were included. When it grew popular, there came the Winter Olympic Games, which includes a variety of winter sports.",0
5150,"I see. Then, what's your favorite winter sport?",0
5151,"Figure skating. In my eye, nothing beats it.",0
5152,Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo.,0
5153,"Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, but also because of many medals they've won, but also because of their spirits.",0
5154,You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too.,0
5155,How do you arrange this summer vacation?,0
5156,I want to travel.,0
5157,Where would you like to go?,0
5158,The seaside.,4
5159,That's really a good idea. Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good. I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian.,4
5160,"I’ Ve been to Qingdao before, so I’ ll choose Dalian. I've heard that the environment there is very good.",4
5161,"Yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday. Last year I went there. It's really.",4
5162,Thank you!,4
5163,"Very glad to know something about you, then what are you going to do when you finish.",4
5164,"Oh, I’ ll go to shanghai to practice there.",0
5165,That’ s a good idea. It must be easy to find a job in shanghai.,4
5166,"I think so, you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there.",4
5167,And English is very useful in your job.,4
5168,"I think it will be very useful in many ways. Beside, shanghai is an important trade center, not only in China, but also in the world, English is useful in almost all walks of life.",4
5169,You will be a very promising one.,4
5170,That’ s my wish.,4
5171,I hear you are expecting your family.,0
5172,"Yes, my parents, and soon my brother as well.",0
5173,I didn't know you had a brother.,6
5174,"Oh, yes, he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often.",0
5175,"Oh, nice. Is he coming on his own or with the family?",4
5176,His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here.,0
5177,Does your brother have just one son?,0
5178,"No, he has two daughters as well. His wife and daughters are visiting her parents. So I won't see them.",0
5179,I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson.,0
5180,"Oh yes, they are really looking forward to it. They went to New Zealand last year and loved it.",0
5181,So when are they all coming?,0
5182,My parents are already here. My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday.,0
5183,"So, Paula, where are you from?",0
5184,"I'm from Canada, originally.",0
5185,From Canada? Where were you born?,0
5186,Montreal.,0
5187,When did you come to Los Angeles?,0
5188,We moved here when I was fourteen.,0
5189,Did you go to school here?,0
5190,"Well, I went to high school here, but I went to college in Texas.",0
5191,Did you get a job right after graduation?,0
5192,"No, I traveled for a while in Europe after college, and then I lived in France.",0
5193,When was that?,0
5194,Let's see... That was about six years ago.,0
5195,I bet that was interesting. What did you do there?,0
5196,I studied French. Anyway... that's enough about me.How about you? Were you born in L. A.?,0
5197,Do you consider yourself a good mother?,0
5198,"Yes, I'm a very good mother and successful career woman.",4
5199,"How can you manage to do both? I mean, it is so hard to be a working mother.",0
5200,"I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself, like keeping housework simple, spending money on things that make life easier, buying yourself things you like, and so on. You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself.",4
5201,Does your husband feel the same?,0
5202,Yes. He is very understanding and supportive.,4
5203,"I find it really hard to express myself in class. I have lots of ideas, but they never seem to come out of my mouth.",0
5204,"let me give you a little advice. You know what the topics are going to be, so prepares what you would like to say in advance.",0
5205,"I often do, but I’ m worried about the responses from other people.",0
5206,"you have to be realistic. Not everyone is going to agree with you, but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion.",0
5207,I’ m worried that what I say will not make sense.,0
5208,we could chat about the topic before class. I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking.,0
5209,that’ s a good idea. What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic?,0
5210,that’ s easy. Express possibilities. People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle.,0
5211,I didn’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy.,0
5212,"the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say. They will reply to your statements, but you can’ t be sure how.",0
5213,Have you got your invitation yet?,0
5214,"My invitation? No, I haven't. My invitation to what?",6
5215,The house warming party.,0
5216,Whose house warming party is it?,0
5217,Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house.,0
5218,"Oh, they have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately.",0
5219,It's out in the suburbs.,0
5220,Have you seen the house?,0
5221,"Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend.",0
5222,Is it nice?,4
5223,"Yes, it is. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen.",4
5224,There's also a garden.,4
5225,"Well, that does sound nice. Have they moved in yet?",4
5226,"They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight.",4
5227,When are they going to have the party?,4
5228,Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow.,4
5229,"Wow, that would be something to look forward to.",4
5230,"hi, darling! I have a one-month vacation saved up. How about a trip to Europe?",0
5231,I could go for that. But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year.,0
5232,"oh, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out. Do you have any other suggestions?",0
5233,"we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places, and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec",0
5234,wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait!,4
5235,tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday?,0
5236,"perfect. I'll start preparing tomorrow. If we're going to drive, I'll need to fill up the tank.",0
5237,"no need. I think it's still plenty full. Even so, I'd rather travel by bus or train. It would cost much less than driving. Oil prices are soaring nowadays, you know.",0
5238,"we can take the train, that will be faster. I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning.",0
5239,"great! Oh, one more thing, don't forget to check the weather before we go. I'd hate to get caught in the rain.",4
5240,no problem. I'm really looking forward to the coming week.,4
5241,"Me, too. Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us.",4
5242,"Hi, Kenny. Let's go for a drink.",0
5243,Sounds good. Where are we going?,0
5244,Somewhere new. It's a great place to pick up chicks.,0
5245,"Need a new. girlfriend, huh?",0
5246,"Yeah, I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it. Whoa, get a load of that!",0
5247,Whew! That getup is terrific!,0
5248,Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful!,0
5249,That too.,0
5250,I'm gonna introduce myself.,0
5251,"If you're lucky, that might do the trick.",0
5252,"Oh, oh, that tears it! I'm getting out of here.",0
5253,Hold on! What's the big hurry?,0
5254,"My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me, my goose is cooked.",0
5255,I wanna finish my drink first. I'll meet you at Sammy's.,0
5256,"OK, catch you later.",0
5257,Valerie! Hi! Wow how are you? It’ s been such a long time!,4
5258,"Darlene! Indeed, it’ s been a while! How have you been? Wow, you look amazing! I love what you’ Ve done with your hair!",4
5259,"Really? Thanks! I went to that hair salon that you told me about, but enough about me! Look at you! You haven’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you! What is your secret!",4
5260,"Ha ha, come on! Well, I’ Ve been watching what I eat, and working out three times a week. By the way, I heard your son recently graduated!",4
5261,"Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know.",4
5262,He is such a handsome guy. He gets his looks from his mother of course!,4
5263,"Thank you! What about your daughter, Pamela? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently.",4
5264,Oh yes. She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended.,4
5265,Such a lovely girl. I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday!,4
5266,"But of course! Well, it’ s been great talking to you, but I have to get going.",4
5267,"Same here! We will catch up soon, maybe over coffee!",4
5268,That would be great! Give me a call!,4
5269,See you soon! Bye! Egg... I can’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.,4
5270,Did you already take the history exam?,0
5271,Yeah. It was hard. When do you take it?,0
5272,I take it tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on. What types of questions did you get?,0
5273,Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr. had on American society.,0
5274,What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?,0
5275,I only had 1 question about him. But you might get more. I dont know if he will have the same exam or not.,0
5276,"Hopefully he will use the same exam, cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class.",0
5277,"If you cant study everything, then that is probably the best way to go.",0
5278,Aright. Thanks for the info. I gotta go to the library now.,0
5279,Good luck.,4
5280,Thanks. See ya.,4
5281,"What's the matter with you, then? You look miserable.",0
5282,It's us.,0
5283,"What do you mean by "" us ""?",0
5284,"Well, we used to talk to each other before we were married. Remember?",0
5285,"What do you mean? We ' re talking now, aren't we?",0
5286,"Oh, yes, but we used to do so much together.",0
5287,Yes. I remember. But we never used to argue. You used to think I was wonderful. Where are you going?,0
5288,Back to live with my parents. That's something else I used to do before we were married. Remember?,0
5289,"Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart?",4
5290,Yes.Do you like it?,4
5291,It's great. and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent.,4
5292,Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it.,6
5293,Is classical music your favorite?,4
5294,Yes. What about you?,4
5295,I Like pop music best. Classical music is a bit too heavy for me. I can't get fully relaxed in it.,0
5296,Pop music doesn't have any depth for me.,0
5297,"Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it.",0
5298,Did you always like pop music.,0
5299,"I think so, since I was in primary school. How long have you been interested in classical music.",0
5300,I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight. From then on. classical music has been an important part of my life.,0
5301,"oh, I didn't know you can play the violin. Do you still play.",6
5302,"Sometimes, but these days I'm often too busy.",0
5303,"Jane, I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon.",0
5304,"A friend and I are planing to go out, why? what's up?",0
5305,"There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum, I was hoping you ' d like to come with me.",0
5306,I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day.,0
5307,What about sunday?,0
5308,"i wish i could, but it's my mums birthday.",0
5309,Maybe next week.,0
5310,"Much as I ' d like to, I am afraid i wont be free next week, I have a lot of work.",0
5311,"Sorry to hear that, I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, I really enjoyed our last chat.",0
5312,"I am really sorry too, maybe I can give you a call sometime.",0
5313,"Have any plans for the weekend, Tom?",0
5314,"Yeah, I’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.",0
5315,"Oh, do you go hiking often?",0
5316,I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.,4
5317,It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?,4
5318,"Sure. But, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?",4
5319,"Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.",4
5320,Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.,4
5321,"Yeah, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.",4
5322,"Well, bring him along too. We’ ll have a great time this weekend.",4
5323,"Thanks, I’ ll ask him.",0
5324,"You've heard of Bruce Jenner, haven't you?",0
5325,"He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics, right?",0
5326,I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles.,0
5327,I can think of better things to dream about...,0
5328,"Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat, with his legs pumping away.",0
5329,That's crazy.,0
5330,Mike! Look at the floor!,6
5331,What's wrong with it?,0
5332,What's wrong with it? It's filthy!,0
5333,Oh...,0
5334,It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes.,0
5335,"Sorry, love.",0
5336,What are you looking for now?,0
5337,My cigarettes.,0
5338,"Well, they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin.",0
5339,In the dustbin! Why didn't you tell me before?,0
5340,Excuse me. Do you study Chinese at this university?,0
5341,"Yes, I do. But my characters are very bad.",0
5342,It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing.,0
5343,Are you Chinese by birth?,0
5344,"Yes, I am. I am from Guangzhou. I am here to study international relations.",0
5345,How do you like it?,0
5346,I like it so far. But my English still needs work.,0
5347,I want to study Mandarin and public relations.,0
5348,"Hey, look over there. It seems that there is something interesting going on. Let's go and have a look.",4
5349,Sure. It's probably a skiing show. Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors.,4
5350,Look at that. It's so dangerous. My mom would never allow me to do that.,0
5351,Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show.,0
5352,You are right. But what if an avalanche happened?,0
5353,They are all great skiers and very experienced. So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim.,0
5354,"Anyway, the show is breathtaking. By the way, where did they get so much snow here?",4
5355,"Well, they have the most advanced snowmaking machine.",0
5356,Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution?,0
5357,It's possible.,0
5358,You'll never guess what I won at work today! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game.,4
5359,"Two, I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me!",6
5360,"Of course! And here's the best part, they are court side seats!",4
5361,How in the world! Who came up with seats like that from your company?,4
5362,Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team!,4
5363,Can't beat that! Thank you accounting guy!,4
5364,"The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle, it's already five.",4
5365,What are we waiting for? Let's go!,4
5366,Let’ s play a game!,0
5367,OK! How about Scrabble?,0
5368,"No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I’ m going to describe someone’ s face, and you guess who it is!",0
5369,OK!,0
5370,"Let’ s see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!",0
5371,"Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!",0
5372,"Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! OK, my turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is also bald!",0
5373,Your future husband!,0
5374,Not funny.,0
5375,"As we know, mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives.",0
5376,"It bears a great many of advantages, but also some weak points.",0
5377,Is it? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone.,0
5378,"For instance, the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study.",0
5379,That's true. Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones.,0
5380,"Actually, it's not the fault of the mobile phone. But people should have a proper attitude towards it. Mobile phone is a tool serving people, not the fetters restricting them.",0
5381,"The bartender just gave the last call. Let's order another round, okay?",0
5382,"Sure, but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close.",0
5383,That sounds good. You order the beer while I go to the bathroom. Where is the can in this place?,0
5384,It's all the way to the back. See that yellow door?,0
5385,Yeah. I think I can find it.,0
5386,You're back already. That sure was quick.,0
5387,That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around. That bathroom is too gross for me.,0
5388,"Well, the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. Anyway. He said it was too close to closing time.",0
5389,"Let's leave then. I could take some fresh air, anyway.",4
5390,"Okay, let's go!",4
5391,"hi, Mary! What do you like to do in your spare time?",0
5392,"well, I spend a lot of time watching movies.",0
5393,"what a confidence! I always watch a lot of movies, too.",4
5394,"oh really, Frank? What kind of movies do you like?",6
5395,"actually, I watch whichever movie there is, be it a comedy, a sci-fi or a suspense movie. How about you?",0
5396,"art films are my favorite, but thrillers are cool, too.",0
5397,really impressive. These two genres are totally different.,0
5398,sure. I enjoy both of them very much.,0
5399,how often do you go to the cinema?,0
5400,"once in a while, I suppose, I usually rent movies at Movie Salon.",0
5401,movie salon? where is that?,0
5402,it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood. I've got a membership there.,0
5403,is it good?,0
5404,"yes, you can find almost all new releases there.",0
5405,really? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership.,0
5406,why not?,0
5407,Hey Suzie. Guess what? I'm having a baby!,4
5408,Really? That's so great. Congratulations.,6
5409,Thanks. I'm so excited. We've been trying for 8 months now.,4
5410,That's really exciting. How many months are you pregnant?,4
5411,Three months.,0
5412,Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl?,0
5413,"I want to, but Bob doesn't. He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way.",0
5414,Maybe it's more exciting not knowing.,4
5415,I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time.,0
5416,There are so many things you have to prepare for.,0
5417,"I know I am going to be busy, but I know I can handle it. I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time.",0
5418,It really must be an exciting time for you guys.,4
5419,Thank you so much.,4
5420,Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow?,4
5421,"Much to my regret, I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then.",0
5422,"We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening, are you free?",4
5423,"Much as we'd like to, but we've booked up already for that time.",0
5424,What a pity! You can't join us.,5
5425,"So sorry. Next time we'll go, thanks anyway.",4
5426,"I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight, do you think have time?",4
5427,Thank you for your inition. I'm free tonight.,4
5428,"Which kind of food do you like, chinese food, western food or sea food?",0
5429,I prefer sea food.,0
5430,ok. I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm.,0
5431,That's fine. I'll be waiting for you.,0
5432,See you later.,0
5433,bye.,0
5434,Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work?,0
5435,Of course! It is the No. 1 stressor in my life. You know job stress has become a very common problem these days. So we must learn to cope with it.,0
5436,Totally agree. What is your solution?,0
5437,"Well, there are two causes of job stress. One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition. So if we want to manage job stress, both we and the companies should do something. For me, I am trying to balance work and leisure time. You know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.",0
5438,You seem to have a very relaxed outlook.,0
5439,It is necessary. Positive attitude helps to prevent stress.,0
5440,"But I don’ t think we can change our working condition. Anyway, we are not the bosses.",0
5441,"I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them, like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities. Our boss is a smart person. He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team.",0
5442,I am so busy today.,0
5443,Can I help you?,4
5444,I’ m not sure. Perhaps you could do the shopping.,0
5445,I’ ll be glad to help.,4
5446,Or maybe make the beds.,0
5447,All you have to do is ask for help.,4
5448,Thanks. That’ s terrific!,4
5449,I’ m ready and willing to help.,4
5450,"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef, so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening.",0
5451,Good. I love Chinese food. What did you order?,4
5452,Something hot and spicy. They look very inviting on the menu. You are going to love them.,4
5453,Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking. I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses. Are you interested?,0
5454,"I'm not sure. I don't enjoy cooking that much. As long as we can order it from a restaurant, we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves.",0
5455,You are right. But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different.,0
5456,You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work.,0
5457,I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today.,0
5458,Do you feel ok?,0
5459,"Not really. After a 12 - hour flight, I've got jetlag, and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu.",0
5460,Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now.,0
5461,Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?,0
5462,You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down.,0
5463,"Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting.",0
5464,"Zach, what's that on your arm?",0
5465,"I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing.",0
5466,It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?,0
5467,"Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks.",0
5468,I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no. we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go.,0
5469,Shouldn't we make an appointment first?,0
5470,"We would, but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse.",0
5471,Whatever you say. I just want to get to my meeting!,0
5472,Do you like being a doctor?,0
5473,"Yes, most of the time. But, sometimes things can get difficult.",0
5474,Can you tell me about it?,0
5475,"You know, sometimes patients can get very unreasonable. They may insist they are sick when they are not.",0
5476,What can you do when this happens?,0
5477,"Not much, usually I'll just keep silent.",0
5478,It's too hot to read.,0
5479,We'd better go out for a walk.,0
5480,Which season do you like best?,0
5481,Spring.,0
5482,How about summer?,0
5483,I dislike it most.,2
5484,Why?,0
5485,Because the hottest season is summer in a year.,0
5486,But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.,0
5487,"Hi, I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle. The name is Jimmy Fox.",0
5488,"I’ m sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.",0
5489,"I don’ t understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?",0
5490,"Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.",0
5491,But the reservation keeps the car here. That’ s why you have the reservation.,1
5492,I know why we have reservations.,0
5493,"I don’ t think you do.If you did, I’ d have a car.See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don’ t know how to hold the reservation and that’ s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.",1
5494,But we do have a compact or an SUV if you’ d like.,0
5495,Fine. I’ ll take the compact.,1
5496,"Alright. We have a blue Ford Focus for you, Mr. Fox. Would you like insurance?",0
5497,"Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.",1
5498,What happened? Why didn't he win?,0
5499,Didn't you hear? He was disqualified.,0
5500,How did that happen? He's so talented! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!,6
5501,"If he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.",0
5502,What? What kind of drugs was he using?,6
5503,He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.,0
5504,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.,2
5505,They are. The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.,2
5506,That's so disappointing. I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.,2
5507,"I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might. Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!",2
5508,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.",0
5509,"I agree. Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.",0
5510,Let's hope so.,0
5511,"Cindy, how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies?",0
5512,That's because Americans love sitcoms.,0
5513,Sitcoms?,0
5514,"Situation comedies. A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly. Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people. If there is one thing that all the shows have in common, it is teaching wholesome values.",0
5515,"In Taiwan, prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies.",0
5516,I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time.,0
5517,Are you interested in history?,0
5518,"Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks.",4
5519,"I love history, but I’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened.",4
5520,I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks!,0
5521,Some people say that history repeats itself.,0
5522,"What does that mean? The same events never happen twice, do they?",0
5523,"The idea is that the people and dates change, but the reason why things happen stay the same.",0
5524,I see. I think I’ d agree with that statement. People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again.,0
5525,"What's the matter, John? you seemed to be restless today.",0
5526,"You see, I've been offered a new job. I can't decide whether to take it or not.",0
5527,"Oh, that's easy. If it's better than the one you are doing now, go for it. That's my advice.",0
5528,It isn't that easy. I hate to quit my present job. People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging.,0
5529,Then what about the salary? Would you get more?,0
5530,"Yes, they say I would get a big sum.",0
5531,Have you discussed it with your wife?,0
5532,"Yes, she leaves it to me.",0
5533,As I say it the work is well worth try. After all you can get a higher salary.,0
5534,I have to think about it.,0
5535,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team. He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second.,0
5536,That’ s great. He’ s the best runner I’ Ve seen this season. I’ m sure he’ ll win a medal at the Olympics.,0
5537,I think you’ re right. I think we have a very good athletics team. They should do well in the Olympics. How many medals do you think we’ ll win?,0
5538,"I really don’ t know. I don’ t think we’ ll win many gold medals, but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones.",0
5539,What do you think our chance are in other events.,0
5540,"In the last Olympics, we did very well in swimming, cycling and ball sports. I think we’ ll do well in those same events.",0
5541,We might get a gold medal in the sailing too. Our team put in a lot of practice.,0
5542,I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total.,0
5543,You are very optimistic!,0
5544,Let's play chess.,0
5545,I haven't played chess for a long time.,0
5546,"That's all right, I'm a beginner. I've just learnt how to play.",0
5547,"Look, there's a chessboard. Those two men have already finished playing.",0
5548,You're a very good player,0
5549,"Not really, but once I won a prize.",0
5550,So did I. I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners.,0
5551,My prize was for the best player in the country. Now let's start playing chess seriously.,0
5552,You have been here for how long? Four months now?,0
5553,"Yeah, about.",0
5554,Do you know Chinese better now?,0
5555,"Oh, definitely. I remember, when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone.",0
5556,"Oh, yeah. Many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.",0
5557,"I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.",0
5558,A shouting match? You’ re so funny. You must be exaggerating. I don’ t believe it.,0
5559,I am not exaggerating at all. I’ m telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time.,0
5560,"Yes, perhaps. Chinese usually don’ t notice that sort of thing. Maybe it’ s quite natural to us.",0
5561,"Yes, absolutely true.",0
5562,"Excuse me, can you tell me the name of the book you read?",0
5563,Harry Potter.,0
5564,Harry Potter? Is that book funny?,0
5565,"Actually, the language itself is not so funny, but you can imagine the scene, that's funny.",0
5566,Got it.,0
5567,Have you ever read this book before?,0
5568,"No, but my little brother likes it very much.",0
5569,It's really a good book. You will like it too.,0
5570,"I'll try to read it. Actually, I like literature very much.",0
5571,"Wow, that sounds like a scholar. By the way, who's your favorite writer?",0
5572,Jane Austen.,0
5573,Me too. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite.,0
5574,I like it too. But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite.,0
5575,"Hey Sandra, what's wrong? You look furious!",0
5576,I've had it with Tim! I think I'm going to quit!,1
5577,But Sandra... you love your job! You spent months trying to get this position. It's perfect for you!,0
5578,Yeah... I know. But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles!,1
5579,What kind of power struggles are you talking about?,0
5580,"Basically, I think Tim is threatened by me. I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career!",1
5581,So he talks about you behind your back?,0
5582,Yes. He's all nice and friendly to my face. But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back!,1
5583,I had a worker like that once. She was always taking credit for my ideas.,0
5584,I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort.,0
5585,"My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits. She liked to name-drop... we would be in a meeting and she would say, yesterday I was chatting with Tom. She meant Tom Solomon... our CEO.",0
5586,"Doris, I'm glad you're home. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do!",3
5587,What is it? What happened?,0
5588,I think someone is stalking me.,3
5589,"No, it can't be. Really? Who?",6
5590,"I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring.He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.",3
5591,What did you do?,0
5592,"I didn't do anything. Finally, he left.But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.",3
5593,Did he leave when you left?,0
5594,Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.,3
5595,What did you do?,0
5596,"Man, I'm hungry. Do you know a good place to have lunch?",0
5597,"Yes, I know a great place. What types of food do you like?",0
5598,"Mexican, Japanese or Chinese would be great.",0
5599,"Oh, I know a place where you might like to eat.",0
5600,Is it close by?,0
5601,It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way?,0
5602,"OK, I'd love the company.",4
5603,This will work out well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.,4
5604,have you ever been to Disneyworld?,0
5605,"when I was young, my parents took me to the one in California. I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld?",0
5606,"the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland, so you must have been to Disneyland.",0
5607,that's right. Why do you ask?,0
5608,"well, I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon.",0
5609,when are you getting married?,0
5610,some time next year. We haven't set the date yet.,0
5611,congratulations! I had no idea.,0
5612,thank you. So what do you think? Would we have a good time?,0
5613,do you like amusement parks?,0
5614,"for the most part, yes. Some of the rides are bit too scary for me, though.",0
5615,"if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can, you'll have a good time.",0
5616,even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark?,0
5617,"even those. It'll be very romantic, I think. You'll have loads of fun.",4
5618,thanks for the advice. I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight.,0
5619,I'm sure he'll love the idea. Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!,4
5620,Matthew? Hi!,4
5621,Steve! Haven't seen you in ages! How long's it been?,4
5622,It's got to be almost a year now.,4
5623,How have you been?,4
5624,I'm pretty good. I've been looking for a place to live recently. My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it.,4
5625,"Yeah, I remember the neighborhood. Have you found a place yet?",0
5626,Not yet. But I am still looking through the classifieds. Wish me luck.,0
5627,"Well, maybe I can help. Remember my neighbor?",4
5628,Mrs. Thou?,0
5629,"Yes, her daughter's having a baby, so she's moving in with her to help out. I think if you are interested, you can come over and have a look.",4
5630,Great. It's a lovely neighborhood. And it would be nice to be neighbors again. It would be just like the old days!,4
5631,I'll ask Mrs. Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know. Has your number changed?,4
5632,Are you ready to go to the mall?,0
5633,Yeah. Dig my new pants?,0
5634,Copycat!,1
5635,What do you mean?,0
5636,"You went out and bought khakis, too!",1
5637,No. Mine are a soft brown. Yours are khaki.,0
5638,Whatever.,0
5639,Have heard of Paul?,0
5640,"No, what?",0
5641,He's got a promotion.,0
5642,You're kidding.,6
5643,"No, they made him vicepresident in charge of sells.",0
5644,I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years.,0
5645,"Well, it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul.",0
5646,Well.Good for him.,0
5647,"Jeff, I'm going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me?",0
5648,I think the supermarket is closed now.,0
5649,"Oh, When does it close?",0
5650,It closes at 7:00 on Sundays.,0
5651,That's too bad.,0
5652,"Don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8: 00.",0
5653,Alright. What do you want to do now?,4
5654,Let's take a walk for a half an hour. My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner.,4
5655,Where does she live?,0
5656,She lives in San Francisco.,0
5657,How long has she lived there?,0
5658,I think she's lived there for about 10 years.,0
5659,That's a long time. Where did she live before that?,0
5660,San Diego.,0
5661,I had a big argument with david yesterday. I hope he’ s not still mad at me.,0
5662,What did you argue about?,0
5663,He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back. He said he didn’ t have the money yet.,0
5664,"Well, he should pay you back. It’ s only fair.",0
5665,"Yes, but I got angry with him too quickly. He probably thought that I mistrusted him. I shouldn’ t have got angry.",0
5666,Did you lend him a lot of money?,0
5667,"Not much. I had to pay an unexpected bill, so I needed the money back.",0
5668,"Well, talk to him about it next time you see him. He probably feels as bad about it as you do. Close friends sometimes have disagreements. It’ s nothing unusual. Neither of you said anything really nasty, did you?",0
5669,"No, we didn’ t. I guess you’ re right. We should patch things up.",0
5670,"Of course you should. You wouldn’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship, would you?",0
5671,Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world?,4
5672,Yes. Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart. They are also the fastest swimmers in the world.,4
5673,They must be amazing animals.,4
5674,They are. I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea.,4
5675,I read that story too. They seem to be able to understand men.,4
5676,They sure can. Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes.,4
5677,"Oh dear, my weight has gone up again.",0
5678,"I am not surprised, you eat too much.",0
5679,And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help.,0
5680,"No, I wouldn't think so.",0
5681,I do wish I could lose weight.,0
5682,"Well, why don't you go on the diet?",0
5683,I've tried diets before but they've never worked.,0
5684,Perhaps you should excercise more. Why don't you go to an exercise class.,0
5685,"Yes, maybe I should.",0
5686,Could you please wait for a minute? I'll buy the tickets,0
5687,All right.,0
5688,Here is your ticket.,0
5689,Thank you.,0
5690,The park will close soon. We Should better go in right now.,0
5691,Really?,6
5692,"Yes, let's go in.",0
5693,"It is a new park, isn't it?",0
5694,"Yes, how do you know?",0
5695,I guessed it.,0
5696,"Well, generally speaking, the park is a window on the world history, a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well.",0
5697,"Oh, how wonderful!",4
5698,I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose. It was very interesting.,0
5699,"I love dogs. They have been used as guards for centuries. Nowadays, they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers.",0
5700,The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow.,0
5701,Horses are useful to people too. We use them for sports and recreation.,0
5702,Don’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts.,0
5703,Can you ride a horse?,0
5704,"Yes, I can. I don’ t ride regularly though. How about you?",0
5705,I can ride too. Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend?,4
5706,What a good idea!,4
5707,Where's Mrs. Johnson?,0
5708,"Just call her Lisa, Mary. She's cooking dinner.",0
5709,I see. Can I sit down?,0
5710,Of course! Make yourself at home.,0
5711,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson.",0
5712,"Please, just call me Tom.",0
5713,"Okay, Tom.",0
5714,Where's Cindy?,0
5715,She's upstairs in my room.,0
5716,Can you tell her to come downstairs? We're about to have dinner.,0
5717,Have you heard of Paul?,0
5718,"No, what?",0
5719,He's got a promotion.,0
5720,You're kidding.,6
5721,"No, they made him vicepresident in charge of sells.",0
5722,"Oh, I don't believe it. He is only being with the company for two years.",6
5723,"Well, it's true. The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul.",0
5724,Well. Good for him.,0
5725,Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School?,0
5726,"Yes, and it's great. What are the events at the sports meeting?",0
5727,"Long-distance race, dash, hurdle race, relay race, standing long jump, high jump, shotput and so on.",0
5728,"Our neighbor, Bruce, will take part in the relay race. Let's go have a look.",0
5729,"OK, let's go.",0
5730,"The competition will begin in 5 minutes, it's tense here.",0
5731,"Wonderful, Bruce is taking the lead.",0
5732,Other competitors have almost caught up with him. They are neck and neck.,0
5733,"Come on, Bruce. Come on, Bruce.",0
5734,"Wow, Bruce crossed the line first.",0
5735,I’ m forming a music band.,0
5736,Do you already know how to play an instrument?,0
5737,"Uh... Yeah! I’ Ve told you a thousand times that I’ m learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.",0
5738,"Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?",0
5739,"We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. Although we still haven’ t found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right?",0
5740,"Yes, I’ m a singer.",0
5741,Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.,4
5742,"Great! Wait here? You don’ t have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice?",4
5743,"Lili, let’ s take a vacation!",0
5744,"George, how can we? Vacations cost money. And this month we don’ t have much money left after paying the rent.",0
5745,"Well, Lili, we can visit different places in the state in our van 10. We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. Trust me, it won’ t cost much.",0
5746,"Where will we sleep, then?",0
5747,In the van.,0
5748,What about other expenses?,0
5749,"Let’ s see. Gas, food, recreation, we won’ t spend much. Come on. Don’ t hesitate. We need to get out of the house once in a while. We have been working hard, haven’ t we?",0
5750,Maybe you’ re right. When do you plan to go?,0
5751,The sooner the better! I can’ t wait!,4
5752,"Oh, I don’ t know where we’ re going yet.",0
5753,"As long as we’ re going, you can decide where to go. I trust your judgments. I know you miss Chinese food, so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time.",0
5754,Let’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field!,4
5755,You have such good ideas!,4
5756,What date will our field trip be on?,0
5757,The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning. Do you want to make note of that on your calendar?,0
5758,"Yes, I will make note of that.",0
5759,"Next Monday is December 2nd. The buses will leave at 8, but we must begin loading at 7",0
5760,I will be there half an hour early.,0
5761,You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th. Do you have a ride?,0
5762,"Yes, someone is picking me up.",0
5763,To get back to campus by 8,0
5764,"Not at the moment — maybe later, though.",0
5765,All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway. See you on Monday!,4
5766,Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today?,0
5767,My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this?,0
5768,Two years or so.,0
5769,That is great.Do you have to work the night shift?,0
5770,"No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week.",0
5771,Do you enjoy work here?,0
5772,"It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy.",0
5773,Take it easy. I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant. I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job.,0
5774,Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss.,4
5775,Glad to hear that.,4
5776,Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe.,4
5777,What's the second solar system?,0
5778,"It's just a system like ours, with a star and a number of planets going around it.",4
5779,Is this good news or bad news?,0
5780,"It's exciting news! If we find a second solar system, we might find a second earth!",4
5781,You mean with people on it?,0
5782,Yes! Isn't that exciting?,4
5783,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?,0
5784,"Sorry, I thought you knew.",0
5785,But you should tell me you were in love with her.,0
5786,Didn't I?,6
5787,You know you didn't.,0
5788,"Well, I am telling you now.",0
5789,"Yes, but you might have told me before.",0
5790,I didn't think you would be interested.,0
5791,You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?,1
5792,"Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.",0
5793,"Oh, you men! You are all the same.",1
5794,How was the movie last night?,0
5795,I didn't really like it.,2
5796,Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography.,0
5797,I found it very disappointing.,2
5798,"She liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see.",0
5799,I wasn't happy with it.,2
5800,Nothing is to your satisfaction.,0
5801,"Honey, I’ ll be right back!",0
5802,Where are you going?,0
5803,I told you already! I’ m going to get my nails done.,0
5804,"Again? You just went last week! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home! Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?",0
5805,"Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself, and my nails look great. You should come with me!",0
5806,Why? I don’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that!,0
5807,"They don’ t only paint my nails! The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least nails coats of nail polish!",0
5808,"Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.",0
5809,Good afternoon!,4
5810,"Good afternoon! Sit down, please.How are you?",4
5811,"I'm very well, thank you.How are you?",4
5812,"Very well too, thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day?",4
5813,"Yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot.",4
5814,Yes.,0
5815,What's the weather like in your country?,0
5816,Mm... It's quite warm now.,0
5817,Where do you live?,0
5818,In London.Where do you live?,0
5819,Here.Near this school.,0
5820,I’ Ve had it! I’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere!,0
5821,So what are you gonna do? Just quit?,0
5822,"That’ s exactly what I am going to do! I’ Ve decided to create my own company! I’ m going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!",0
5823,Have you ever written up a business plan before?,0
5824,"Well, no, it can’ t be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that’ s it, right?",0
5825,"You couldn’ t be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.",0
5826,"Well, that seems easy enough.",0
5827,"Wait, there’ s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.",0
5828,Geez. Is that all?,0
5829,"Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!",0
5830,Umm. I think I’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!,0
5831,What’ s on TV tonight?,0
5832,"Not much, that new reality-TV show, Ally McNeal, oooo, Dark Angel.",0
5833,Wait a second. I want to watch Ally McNeal.,0
5834,"Oh, come on. That’ s such a girl’ s show.",0
5835,No it’ s not. It’ s just funny.,0
5836,"Yeah, if you’ re a girl.",0
5837,"Well, you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl.",0
5838,That’ s not true. Dark Angel is a good show.,0
5839,It’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits.,0
5840,"O. K., O. K. Let’ s forget it. There’ s a football game on too.",0
5841,No way. I’ m watching Ally McNeal. Go to John’ s to watch the game.,0
5842,"Sarah, what did you do today?",0
5843,I went shopping.,0
5844,Did you buy anything?,0
5845,"Yes, I bought a few things.",0
5846,What did you buy?,0
5847,I bought this coat. Do you like it?,0
5848,"Yeah, I like it a lot. It's very pretty. Where did you buy it?",4
5849,At the mall on 5th street.,0
5850,Was it expensive?,0
5851,"No, it wasn't expensive. It was on sale for 20 dollars.",0
5852,That's cheap.,0
5853,I know. It was a really good deal.,4
5854,I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while. It's been really hot lately.,0
5855,"Hi, Victor. How are you?",0
5856,"Oh, I'm fine.",0
5857,"So, are you going to go to class tonight?",0
5858,Maybe... but I don't think so.,5
5859,Really? What's the matter?,6
5860,I don't know. I'm just feeling a little sad.,5
5861,"Listen. Come with me to class, and after class we can go out for dinner.",4
5862,"Now that's a good idea. Thanks a lot, Brian. I'm feeling better already.",4
5863,What's that book you have under your arm?,0
5864,It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months.,0
5865,How in the world did you get a copy? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn.,0
5866,I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.,0
5867,Is it really worth paying for?,0
5868,I can't tell yet. I haven't got beyond the first chapter.,0
5869,"If it's any good, I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.",0
5870,"Come on, you are left behind!",0
5871,"Wow, I can't catch my breath. You are running too fast, honey.",0
5872,You just need more exercise.,0
5873,"Yes, but you need to slow down. This is jogging, not racing!",0
5874,I don't care. I want to burn up my fat.,0
5875,But running so fast is not good for people over forties.,0
5876,Why?,0
5877,We are not as athletic as we were when young. Mild exercise is more suitable for us.,0
5878,But I want to burn up more calories!,0
5879,"In fact, in order to burn up your fat, you must take it slowly for a longer time.",0
5880,Really? I will slow down then.,6
5881,"Hello, Daisy, how are you doing?",0
5882,"Fine, thank you. I haven’ t seen you for quite some time. What have you been up to recently?",0
5883,"I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home, so you wouldn't have seen me. Recently, I've been obsessed with horror films.",0
5884,"Oh, how can you be infatuated with horror films? They're so scary.",0
5885,"Yeah, you are right I used to not watch horror films, but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month, I fell in love with them.",0
5886,"It's amazing. But if I were you, I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one.",4
5887,But it's really exciting.,4
5888,"Maybe, but I would rather watch romance, science fiction, crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture. I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one.",0
5889,Basically. you'll watch any type of movie except horror.,0
5890,Yep.,0
5891,I think you should have a try someday. Maybe you'll change your mind.,0
5892,"Maybe. After all, I am grown up now.",0
5893,Are you an art aficionado?,0
5894,"Not really. I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year. I hardly know anything about art or sculpture. You are a true art lover, aren’ t you?",0
5895,"I love going to art galleries, particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art.",0
5896,I never understand the meaning of those painting. They are too abstract for me. I didn’ t pay much attention in art class at school.,0
5897,Art isn’ t for everyone. I’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery. It’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture.,0
5898,"I like sculpture, especially that from ancient rome or Greece. What time are you thinking of going? I’ d love to go with you.",0
5899,I thought I’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards. Does that sound ok to you? Bus 51 goes directly there.,0
5900,That sounds fine. What time shall we meet at the bus stop?,4
5901,Let’ s meet at 12 thirty. it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits.,4
5902,"Hello, Bessie.",4
5903,"Hello, Jack.Happy birthday!",4
5904,"My birthday? I forgot it, Thank you for remembering my birthday.",6
5905,"I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness, good health and continued success. I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers. I hope you'll like them.",4
5906,Thanks a lot. I'm so touched.,4
5907,"Now let me sing "" Happy birthday "" for you.",4
5908,Thank you very much.,4
5909,"Why don't you sit down and relax, darling?",0
5910,I don't want to.,1
5911,"Well, come over and talk to me then.",0
5912,Certainly not.,1
5913,May I turn on the TV then?,0
5914,Turn on the TV for what?,1
5915,So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.,0
5916,"Listen to the music? And who will cook dinner, will you?",1
5917,"I will, but let's go to the disco after dinner.",0
5918,"To a disco? Oh, no. You know I hate it.",2
5919,Diane Grant? I haven't seen you for ages!,6
5920,Brian! How have you been?,4
5921,"Pretty good. Say, you've really changed!",4
5922,"Oh, well, I've lost some weight. And my hair is longer than before.",4
5923,"Well, you look great! How are you?",4
5924,I'm doing really well. I got married about three years ago. I have two kids now.,4
5925,That's terrific!,4
5926,"Peter, how often do you exercise?",0
5927,"Well, I swim and run every day.",0
5928,"Now, tell me, what do you eat?",0
5929,"Well, I don't eat any meat, but I do eat fish and eggs.",0
5930,Do you eat a lot of vegetables?,0
5931,"Oh yes, and fruit, I love fruit.",0
5932,What do you drink?,0
5933,"Well, I never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. They are very bad for you.",0
5934,What’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend?,0
5935,We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River.,0
5936,How hard is the climb?,0
5937,It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet.,0
5938,What did you do last week?,0
5939,We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff. It was very exciting.,0
5940,Wow! That sounds like a lot of fun. I’ m sorry I missed it.,4
5941,"Well, you should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb.",4
5942,"Yeah, I will. See you then!",4
5943,O. K. See you.,4
5944,How many languages can you speak?,0
5945,I can speak French and German.,0
5946,How well can you speak them?,0
5947,"I can speak German quite well, but I can't speak French very well.",0
5948,Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now?,0
5949,"No, but I'll be able to tomorrow.",0
5950,Gross! What are you doing to yourself?,2
5951,Chill! I'm just curling my eyelashes.,0
5952,It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture.,2
5953,You're such a wimp! You're afraid of an eyelash curler.,0
5954,"Well, you might pinch your eyelid! Or lose an eyeball!",2
5955,It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards.,0
5956,What a beautiful watch. It goes very well with your ring.,4
5957,Thank you.,4
5958,Is that your wedding ring?,4
5959,I'm not married yet. It's my engagement ring.,4
5960,"Well, congratulations. When is the big date?",4
5961,In June.,4
5962,Did you have the watch before getting the ring?,4
5963,"Actually, we bought the ring together after I got the watch.",4
5964,You did a fabulous job with the selection. It's gorgeous.,4
5965,Thank you so much.,4
5966,What kind of watch is it?,0
5967,It's a Tag Heer.,0
5968,"If you don't mind me asking, how much do they cost?",0
5969,This one is $ 1500. But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000.,0
5970,That's why it looks so nice. I should have figured. You always get what you pay for.,4
5971,Yeah. I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones.,4
5972,"Hi, Jack, how have you been?",0
5973,Not very well.,5
5974,Why? Looks like you're feeling very down! What happened?,0
5975,Nothing.,5
5976,"Come on. For a man who's feeling so, down, there're usually two reasons. Either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart. Since you're so successful, it must be the latter.",0
5977,"Well, you're right. I just broke up with Jane.",5
5978,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you two were made for each ocher.",0
5979,"Well, you never know. I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young.",5
5980,"Well, she is not to blame. It's always difficult to choose between career and family.",0
5981,Maybe you're right.,5
5982,"Jack, I don't know what to say to comfort you, but cheer up! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate, your perfect match!",0
5983,"Yeah, but it's hard to forget her at moment. You know, we were together for almost five years. It's really hard...",5
5984,Did you watch the volleyball match last night?,0
5985,Yeah.,0
5986,Who won?,0
5987,China.,0
5988,What is the score?,0
5989,China beat Brazil three to zero.,0
5990,Wonderful.,4
5991,"What do you mean? If he was a good programmer, he should have been raking it in.",0
5992,The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options. But Bob didn't want to play that game again.,0
5993,Again?,0
5994,"At his last start-up, Bob worked for stock and no salary. They folded and he made zip.",0
5995,Ouch.,0
5996,Now he only works freelance. Hundred bucks an hour.,0
5997,Good morning. I’ m from the New York book review. Could I ask you some questions about your latest book?,0
5998,Sure. Take a seat... what would you like to know?,0
5999,"First, I’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story.",0
6000,That’ s correct. It’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago. The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case.,4
6001,How do you research your books?,4
6002,I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people.,4
6003,I really like your books. I’ Ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again!,4
6004,Thank you. Let met sign it for you... there you go.,4
6005,Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about?,4
6006,"There’ s a real mix of stories in the book. I haven’ t finished all of them yet, though. Many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your business card, I’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review.",4
6007,Thanks very much. I’ m sure it will sell well. I can’ t wait to read it. Here’ s my card. Thank you for you time.,4
6008,For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party.,4
6009,That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library!,4
6010,I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas.,4
6011,That is right up my alley. You say party and I'm there.,4
6012,Perfect. It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people.,4
6013,Will it be an all day event?,0
6014,Yes. And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library.,0
6015,That was quick thinking.,0
6016,I'm so glad I bought this watch!,4
6017,Cool! Flashy red lines!,4
6018,I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned.,4
6019,Is it waterproof?,4
6020,Isn't that a silly question? You know how much of an athlete I am.,4
6021,"Uh, huh... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for?",4
6022,"Well, surfing, scuba diving...",4
6023,Do you take a bus to and from work?,0
6024,"Yeah, everyday. And there’ s only one choice. All the other buses are going the other direction.",0
6025,"Hmm. I have the same problem. When I leave work, it’ s always rush hour. So the buses are always crowded.",0
6026,"Oh, yeah, it’ s terrible. I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China. It’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus, and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt.",0
6027,"That sounds terrible the way you describe it. But you know, not long ago I really suffered on the bus.",0
6028,What happened? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus?,0
6029,"You just can’ t imagine! I waited for the first bus but it was too full, so I waited for the second, and it was still very crowded. Then I decided not to wait for the next one, and got on the second bus. It was so full that I had to stand on one foot! No kidding!",0
6030,"Hmm. Good exercise, uh?",0
6031,"Yeah, absolutely!",0
6032,"And it’ s so much fun. One day, the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl’ s behind was pressed against my front. I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her.",0
6033,"You were so happy, weren’ t you?",0
6034,What do you think? I’ m a good boy.,0
6035,"Look! Mom, that's amazing! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements.",4
6036,"Yeah, they all received very strict training. A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice.",4
6037,And all their movements are so elegant. It seems like dancing in the water.,4
6038,"Exactly, you know, water ballet puts dancing, music and swimming together.",0
6039,There you go! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming.,0
6040,"That's my boy! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920. And in 1984, it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games.",0
6041,"Wow, Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad. I must learn from you.",0
6042,"My little boy, you should learn more from me. I'm almost thirty years older than you.",0
6043,"OK, you're the boss. Look, Mom, one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool.",0
6044,"Oh, my God. It's so dangerous. And he might break his leg. You mustn't do anything like that.",0
6045,"Hey Rachael, what's up? How is your day?",0
6046,"Not bad.We have had a big meeting today, remember?",0
6047,"Oh, yea. I forgot.So how did it go?",0
6048,Pretty well. I think the boss liked my ideas.,4
6049,"Great, so what happens now?",0
6050,"Well, I have to write the proposal. I'm pretty excited about it.",4
6051,Do you believe in UFOs?,0
6052,"Of course, they are out there.",0
6053,But I never saw them.,0
6054,"Are you stupid? They are called UFOs, so not everybody can see them.",0
6055,You mean that you can them.,0
6056,That's right. I can see them in my dreams.,0
6057,They come to the earth?,0
6058,No. Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space.,0
6059,Aliens from the outer space? Do you talk to them? What do they look like?,0
6060,"OK, OK, one by one, please! They look like robots, but they can speak. Their mission is to make friends with human beings.",0
6061,That means that you talk to them? In which language?,0
6062,"Of course in English, they learn English on Mars too.",0
6063,Wow. Sounds fantastic!,4
6064,"You look so happy, Anna. Any good news?",4
6065,Yes. I’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest.,4
6066,Really? Congratulations!,4
6067,"Thank you, Paul.",4
6068,"By the way, would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening? Tomorrow is my birthday.",0
6069,"Good, happy birthday to you!",4
6070,"Not so soon. It’ s not my birthday today. Well, you’ ll come, won’ t you?",0
6071,"Sure, I will. Thank you for inviting me.",4
6072,My pleasure.,4
6073,"Hey, May, look, Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday?",0
6074,"Yes, that's right. That's the poster of the The Witch.",0
6075,"May, I really regret watching it with you last night.",0
6076,Did it scare you?,0
6077,Of course not. I just thought the movie was... boring.,0
6078,"Boring? Come on, you clutched to my arm all the time.",0
6079,"Well, I admit. The ghosts were scary.",0
6080,I like scary movies.,0
6081,That's Gucci's influence. I love science fiction movies!,0
6082,Of course you do. They are silly stories just for little kids like you.,0
6083,Don't call me kid. I am a grownup.,0
6084,Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight?,0
6085,Of course! I can watch them without you!,0
6086,"Oh, really?",6
6087,I know you have a son. How old is he?,0
6088,He's going to turn six next month.,0
6089,Who is looking after him?,0
6090,My mother-in - law. She retired last year.,0
6091,You really are lucky!,4
6092,"Yeah, I know.",4
6093,"So Janet, do you do any sports?",0
6094,"Well, I go to the gym a lot. I am a member of a gym nearby.",0
6095,"Yeah, how often do you go?",0
6096,About three times a week if I can.,0
6097,Not bad! Do you do any other sports?,0
6098,"Not really. I’ d really like to try golf, though.",0
6099,"Hello, Ken.",0
6100,"Hello, George.",0
6101,Have you just been to the cinema?,0
6102,"Yes, I have.",0
6103,What’ s on?,0
6104,Paris in the Spring.,0
6105,"Oh, I’ Ve already seen it. I saw it on television last year. It’ s an old film, but it’ s very good.",0
6106,"Paris is a beautiful city. I have never been there. Have you ever been there, Ken?",0
6107,"Yes, I have. I was there in April.",0
6108,"Paris in the spring, eh?",0
6109,"It was spring, but the weather was awful. It rained all the time.",0
6110,Just like dear old London!,0
6111,Where are you going?,0
6112,I'll accompany my wife to the hospital.,0
6113,What's wrong with her.,0
6114,She is expecting.,4
6115,Congratulations to you.,4
6116,Thank you.,4
6117,Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today?,0
6118,There are a few stories about natural disasters. There is a massive forest fire in Australia. It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers.,0
6119,Was it caused accidentally or naturally? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa.,0
6120,"Nobody knows at the moment, but it has been very hot there recently. The drought in Africa is causing starvation. Millions of people have migrated to try and find food.",0
6121,What is the international community doing to help?,0
6122,The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies. Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies. Refugee camps have been set up across the region.,0
6123,How many countries have been affected?,0
6124,"Six have been seriously affected, but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries.",0
6125,I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran.,0
6126,Yes. There have been a few there recently. They say that this one was not a big quake. The Iranians are dealing with it on their own. They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u,0
6127,Does the newspaper say anything about casualties?,0
6128,"So far, less than 20 people have died, but over 100 are in hospital.",0
6129,You received a letter in the mail.,0
6130,Give it here.,0
6131,Who’ s the letter from?,0
6132,I think it’ s my acceptance letter from NYU.,0
6133,I want to know what it says.,0
6134,They didn’ t accept me.,0
6135,Are you serious?,0
6136,It’ s the truth.,0
6137,Are you okay?,0
6138,I really wanted to get into NYU.,5
6139,I am really sorry to hear that.,5
6140,It’ s okay. I’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway.,4
6141,Why are you so quiet?,0
6142,My girlfriend just broke up with me.,5
6143,You must feel terrible now.,0
6144,Yeah.,5
6145,"I remember my first break up. It was the worst feeling in the world. I was crying everyday for three months. And slowly, it got better. I know you'll feel better too.",0
6146,You've been through this too?,6
6147,"Yeah. I remember it very clearly. The pain makes it easy to remember. I know you're really hurting right now, but you know many people experience break ups.",0
6148,But it hurts too much.,5
6149,"I know it's painful, but it's only temporary. After the pain goes away, you'll find other girls.",0
6150,What if I don't want to find another girl?,0
6151,"You'll change your mind. Look at everyone in the world. They all break up and move on. The faster you understand this, the quicker you will recover.",0
6152,You're right.,4
6153,"I also know you must still have strong feelings for her, but try to think of all the bad things. You know she didn't treat you that well. Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with?",4
6154,Yeah. Thanks for the talk.,4
6155,I'll give you a call later. We should hang out. It's good to be around people.,4
6156,Ok. I'll talk to you later.,4
6157,"Excuse me, what do you want for this bag?",0
6158,Let me see. The one goes for $ 17.,0
6159,Would you take $ 12?,0
6160,"No, I can’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14?",0
6161,13.50?,0
6162,"Sorry, $ 14 is the lowest I can go.",0
6163,"Hey Nick, what are you up to?",0
6164,"Not much, just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come?",0
6165,Seriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don’ t know man.,0
6166,"Yeah, it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that’ s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.",0
6167,Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!,4
6168,"Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’ t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For example, never handle a weapon that you haven’ t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn’ t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!",0
6169,"Wow, I didn’ t know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!",0
6170,"The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?",0
6171,Let’ s do it!,0
6172,"What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps.",0
6173,I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated.,5
6174,"come on, nothing can be that bad.",0
6175,"but promise me, you'll keep it a secret.",0
6176,"ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?",0
6177,I've fallen in love with my boss.,0
6178,really? Is he married?,6
6179,"no, of course not. He is still single.",0
6180,then what's your problem?,0
6181,I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.,5
6182,"oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.",0
6183,"worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days.",5
6184,office romance is very tricky.,0
6185,it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.,5
6186,"cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.",0
6187,You're not looking happy. What's the matter?,0
6188,"Oh, nothing special. I'm just a bit tired.",0
6189,With the job?,0
6190,"With everything, with everybody, with all this!",0
6191,A good suggestion for you. You need a holiday.,0
6192,"It wasn't always like this, you know.",0
6193,What do you mean?,0
6194,"Well, I mean. We always do the same thing. There's no variety in our lives.",0
6195,You need a holiday. That's what's the matter.,0
6196,"Certainly, perhaps.",0
6197,"I wonder what he looks like. Oh, I can't wait to see him! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat. ( looking around for him ) oh, there is.",1
6198,"Hey, Isabelle...",0
6199,Logan! Why on earth are you hiding here? White hat! Come on! Don't tell me you're the guy! It can't be true.,1
6200,"Yes, I am the guy.",0
6201,What a bummer! You set me up?,1
6202,Let me explain. I didn't mean to hurt you...,0
6203,How dare you! ( starts to walk off ),1
6204,"Hang on one second. Hear me out, just this once, Isabella!",0
6205,Why did you lie to me in the email?,1
6206,I didn't lie. You just didn't ask me my real name.,0
6207,I should have known it was you. No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly. I thought I might have found the one for me.,1
6208,"I'm sorry. It was cruel of me. But I promise it will never happen again? Look, there's a nice restaurant. Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over.",0
6209,"Peter, how often do you exercise?",0
6210,"Well, I swim and run every day.",0
6211,"Now, tell me, what do you eat?",0
6212,"Well, I don't eat any meat, but I do eat fish and eggs.",0
6213,Do you eat a lot of vegetables?,0
6214,"Oh yes, and fruit, I love fruit.",4
6215,What do you drink?,0
6216,"Well, I never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. They are very bad for you.",0
6217,What do you drink?,0
6218,Did you watch the volleyball match last night?,0
6219,Yeah.,0
6220,Who won?,0
6221,China.,0
6222,What was the score?,0
6223,China beat Brazil 3 to 0.,0
6224,Wonderful!,4
6225,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code, I still think people would wear formal clothing to work.",0
6226,I wouldn't be so sure... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in.,0
6227,"Maybe that's true for some positions, but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree. They dress for success! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans. It's just not respectful to you client.",0
6228,"I think what you wear is so overrated. I would rather have a down-to-earth, honest and solid sales person than a painted, patent leather, designer suite salesman.",0
6229,"It's not as simple as that. People judge you by your appearance, whether you like it or not. So dressing professional is being professional. The image that you portray to others is so important in business. It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale.",0
6230,"Maybe you're right, but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day!",0
6231,Isn't it wonderful walking here?,4
6232,What do you mean?,0
6233,I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us.,4
6234,"Yes, look over there. That's the Empire State Building. My book says it's 102 stories tall.",4
6235,It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?,0
6236,"You're right, but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering.",0
6237,What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue?,0
6238,Quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center. It's a landmark in the history of architecture.,0
6239,What's there after that?,0
6240,"Well then, there's a Central Park. Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world.",0
6241,What are they all for?,0
6242,"Most of them are office buildings, huge department stores, and hotels but some are just private homes. New York is one of the financial centers of the world. And there are lots of very expensive places.",0
6243,"Hey Kevin, what are you doing here? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying?",0
6244,I needed to get out of the house. My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them.,0
6245,What did she tell them? Is she dropping out of college?,0
6246,Nothing that serious. She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend.,0
6247,And your parents took it badly?,0
6248,That's putting it mildly. My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her.,0
6249,"Ouch, that sounds bad. What did your sister do?",0
6250,"She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend, how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody, and so on. My dad said she's too young to do this, and that she should move out right away.",0
6251,How long has your sister been with her boyfriend?,0
6252,Three years. They've been dating since freshman year. They're even talking about marriage.,0
6253,Really? Then I guess living together would be a good idea.,6
6254,What do you mean?,0
6255,"Well, these days too many people are getting divorced. If they live together, then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not.",0
6256,"I guess so. Better to find out now than after you're married, when it's harder to get out.",0
6257,"Do you speak only English in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish?",0
6258,"Oh, we never speak Spanish in class! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English.",0
6259,I suppose she's right. Does she speak English very slowly?,0
6260,Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said.,0
6261,It must be interesting to study English.,0
6262,Mario and I are the best students in the class. Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good.,4
6263,Is English pronunciation easy or difficult?,0
6264,Sometimes it's difficult. Some words look different from the way one pronounces them.,0
6265,It's quiet everywhere in winter.,0
6266,Yes. I like winter.,0
6267,Me too.,0
6268,It's snowing heavily. What about taking a walk?,4
6269,That's a good idea. Let's go!,4
6270,What a heavy snow! Look! The water is frozen.,4
6271,Take care! Don't slip on the ground.,4
6272,I've got it. I like the feeling of stepping on the ice.,4
6273,Yes. Very wonderful.,4
6274,There is a snowman over there.,4
6275,How lovely it is!,4
6276,Who are those guys?,0
6277,"Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’ Neal, they are the Los Angeles Lakers’ star players.",0
6278,Oh.,0
6279,"Wait a second. He shoots, he scores!",6
6280,All right!,6
6281,"Here comes Jordan, though.",4
6282,"Wow, Michael Jordan’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch.",4
6283,"Yeah. He’ s older, so he doesn’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger, but when he does, it’ s still amazing.",4
6284,Which team do you think will win?,4
6285,The Lakers. Jordan is the only good player Washington has.,4
6286,"I am sorry to trouble you again, Mr.Stone.",0
6287,It's ok. What do you want to ask?,0
6288,Where should I go after I arrived at the university?,0
6289,The first place you should go is the International Center.,0
6290,Why?,0
6291,You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers.,0
6292,What kind of role do foreign student advisers play?,0
6293,"They'll discuss personal concerns, housing, adjustment, finances and other matters with you.",0
6294,Can we get any more help at the International Center?,0
6295,"Yes, a lot more. If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester, you can get your student ID and social security number there. They will keep your documents up-to-date. They will offer an orientation program for new comers. They will also help you contact your department and registration office.",0
6296,I see. It must be worth going to.,0
6297,"Besides these, the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours, home hospitality, speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students. In cooperation with nationality clubs, student associations and other organizations, the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year.",0
6298,Wonderful. It is a home for foreign students.,4
6299,"It sure is. They also serve tea, coffee and refreshments. The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful. Everyone loves them.",4
6300,"hi, Lander. What's wrong?",0
6301,I can hardly make ends meet these days.,0
6302,same here. I have't brought any new clothes for three months.,0
6303,my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise.,0
6304,true. The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities.,0
6305,definitely. I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month.,0
6306,"the biggest price jump is for pork, so most people have to turn to chicken.",0
6307,is that inflation?,0
6308,"inflation is more than just the rising prices, I guess. But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation.",0
6309,has the government taken some measures to curb it?,0
6310,yes. The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy.,0
6311,but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy.,0
6312,you said it. I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending.,0
6313,how?,0
6314,"for a start, we can take the public transport to work. You know, running a car is a big expense.",0
6315,sounds a good idea.,4
6316,"OK, everyone. Gather around. Here are the rules. No tackling. No pushing.",0
6317,You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt. That's a foul.,0
6318,Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched.,0
6319,You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees.,0
6320,"The touchdown lines are there and there. OK, let's play!",4
6321,"Before we start, let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men.",0
6322,Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China?,0
6323,"Yeah, almost. But there is one thing.",0
6324,What?,0
6325,"I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but...",0
6326,What is it?,0
6327,Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others.,0
6328,That makes you feel uncomfortable?,0
6329,Yeah. we never do that in a public office.,0
6330,Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.,0
6331,"I have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.",0
6332,"Well, that's not rare. I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus.",0
6333,Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him?,6
6334,Yeah.,0
6335,"Oh, I'm shocked.",6
6336,Hi. Have you got a personal computer?,0
6337,Certainly. What's the matter?,0
6338,I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet.,0
6339,Sure. I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores.,0
6340,Great! It's just like viewless stores. But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line?,0
6341,"That's simple. Just click the hyperlink, www.taobao.com or www. ebay.com, and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen, and then you can place an order online with the sales company. And the goods will be delivered to your place.",0
6342,Is the service charged?,0
6343,No. it's free.,0
6344,Really. I'll get a computer at once.,0
6345,"Frank’ s getting married, do you believe this?",0
6346,Is he really?,6
6347,"Yes, he is. He loves the girl very much.",0
6348,Who is he marring?,0
6349,"A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.",0
6350,Have they set a date for the wedding?,0
6351,Not yet.,0
6352,"OK. Come back into the classroom, class.",0
6353,"Does the class start again, Mam?",0
6354,"Yes, but to the heath, this break has long enough.",0
6355,"Oh, breaktime flies.",5
6356,"Come on, baby. It’ s time now.",0
6357,"Mam, another minute, could I?",0
6358,"Hurry up, little boy.",0
6359,Do you have any hobbies?,0
6360,"Yes, I like collecting things.",4
6361,"Oh, that’ s interesting, and but what kind of things?",4
6362,"Several things, for example, Very coins, stamps, stones and so on.",0
6363,Stones? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones?,6
6364,"Yes, stones.",0
6365,"well, I can’ t just imagine it.",0
6366,What a nice day!,4
6367,yes. How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass?,0
6368,"great, let's go!",4
6369,"hey, darling, I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day. I was so relaxed. It felt as if I were in another world.",4
6370,"exactly. You know, the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon. You remember? The island, the sound of the waves, the salty sea air and the sunshine...",4
6371,"yes, it was wonderful but it's already been a year. How time flies!",0
6372,"why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary? We can go to the same beach, stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant.",0
6373,are you kidding? Can you afford it? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice?,6
6374,"never mind that, I'll take care of it. Are you available next week?",0
6375,"yeah, I think so.",0
6376,ok. I'll make the arrangements. It will be great.,4
6377,wonderful! I'll start packing our suitcases.,4
