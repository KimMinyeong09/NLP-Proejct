107,I am just waiting for my friends. It won't be long.,0

111,I didn't see it.,0
112,"I am sorry, sir. I have to give you a ticket. You can appeal to the court within 14 days. You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault.",5
113,Are you a goal-oriented person?,0
114,"Yes, I am. I always make a plan before I do anything.",0
115,Where do you want to be in 5 years?,0
116,I don't want to have a specific title. I just want to enjoy what I am doing.,0
117,That sounds very reasonable.,0
118,It's the most important thing to me.,0
119,"If you are hired, how long do you plan to stay with us?",0
120,That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me.,0

130,"Oh, current accounts don't pay out interest.",0
131,Why is that?,0
132,"It's primarily designed for business transactions. That is, writing checks to pay for bills, buying things and sending money. We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account.",0
133,I see. How do I draw money for my own use then?,0
134,"Good morning, Helen.",0
135,"Good morning, Steven.",0
136,"So, what's the status of our advertising campaign?",0
137,It'll be a national campaign starting next week.,0
138,What style will the ads be?,0
139,"I suggest that we focus on slice of life, showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich.",0

146,Is it good?,0
147,Sure. It's a most popular dish.,0
148,"I think I'll try it, and give me some green salad together.",0
149,We have two dressings for salad. Which one would you like?,0
150,What kind do you have?,0
151,We have French and Thousand Island.,0
152,Make it Thousand Island.,0
153,Taxi!,0
154,"Where will you go, sir?",0
155,Friendship Hotel.,0

163,"Hi, Mark.",0
164,"Hi, Bill. I’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday.",0
165,All right.,0
166,"So, what do we do now?",0
167,This is the lease. You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant. The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords.,0
168,"Okay. ( Reads the lease ) So, according to the lease, I’ ll deposit one month’ s rent as a security deposit, and I have to pay the first month’ s rent in advance. I understand that I’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs.",0

174,Can I sign the lease right now?,0
175,Good morning! What can I do for you?,0

178,How much does a six-day tour by train cost?,0
179,Five hundred yuan.,0
180,Does that include hotels and meals?,0
181,"Oh, yes, and admission tickets for places of interest as well.",0
182,That sounds reasonable. What about the five-day flying journey? How much is that?,0
183,Eight hundred and fifty yuan.,0
184,Covering all expenses?,0
185,Yes. But there is no half fare for children. They must pay full fare.,0
186,I can't believe you wear jeans to the office! Are you trying to lose your job?,6
187,"Of course not. I'm just observing casual day. On Fridays, the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire.",0
188,Wow! Nobody told me about that. Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image?,6
189,"We don't think so. Casual days are becoming more common, and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes.",0
190,I guess it lets people express their individual tastes. But won't some people abuse it?,0
191,"Not really. Besides, there is a separate dress code for casual day. People can't just wear whatever they want.",0
192,It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity.,0
193,"Believe it or not, it has the opposite effect. Employees are actually more productive on casual days.",0
194,"ABC Company, my name is Lucy. How can I help you?",0
195,"Hello, Lucy, this is Monica. I’ m calling for the accountant position. I saw the information about the vacancy on your company’ s website. Is it still available?",0

If all these is not problem for you, I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly.",0
199,The notification period of my current job is not that long and I’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures. It makes the whole job even more interesting. I will send my resume to you still this week.,0
200,Can I help you?,0
201,"Yes, do you have any rooms available?",0
202,A single?,0
203,No. I need a double and three triples. My family is waiting for me in the car.,0

218,Including my keys?,0
219,"Yes, and please step over there.",0
220,All right. What shall I do now?,0
221,Just open your bags so we can check them. After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine.,0
222,I've got film in my bag.,0
223,That's all right. This machine will not damage the film.,0
224,That's fine.,0
225,Can I have your boarding pass? We need to stamp it.,0
226,Sure. Here you are.,0
227,Thank you.,0
228,Am I through now?,0
229,Yes. Here is your boarding pass.,0
230,Thank you and goodbye.,0
231,"Welcome to Flash Foot, sir.How can I help you?",0
232,I’ d like extra prints made of these photos.,0

248,"Yes, it's not too bad. Our sales are going up year after year. And we still have a large potential production capacity.",0
249,"Well, what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales?",0
250,"That's a good idea. So far, we have several agents abroad.",0
251,We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools. What do you think?,0
252,That sounds good.,0
253,"Then, what's your usual commission rate for your agents?",0
254,"Usually, we give a commission of 4 % to our agents.",0
255,"4 % is too low, I think. You see, we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion, such as advertising on radio or TV, printing booklets, leaflets, catalogues and so on. It all costs money, 4 % is not enough.",0
256,Don't worry. We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase.,0
257,You mean to saya,0
258,It sounds OK. Then how do you pay the commission?,0
259,We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment.,0
260,"All right. If it's okay, we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately.",0
261,Think it over. We hope to keep a good business relationship with you.,0
262,Thank you for your help.,0
263,I'm glad these batteries are on sale.,4

266,"I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale.",0
267,Oh. You're right. I misread the ad.,0
268,"Yes, many people make that mistake.",0
269,"Well, you can't blame them. It's a confusing ad.",0
270,You're right. Many ads are like that.,0
271,"Well, as long as I'm here.",0
272,"Just one second, and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale.",0
273,"Hi, Jack, we are having a party tonight, wanna coming enjoy us? You can bring your girlfriend, Tina.",0
274,I don't have a girlfriend. I'm single.,0
275,"Oh, that's right. Well, there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight, anyway.",0
276,"No, I like being single. I never thought lonely, I'm focus on my career. Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success.",0
277,Why is that?,0
278,"Because I'm living a real world, a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money. Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money.",0
279,"I agree, a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun, too.",0
280,"So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?",0
281,"Yeah, I’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.",0
282,You’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?,1
283,"Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems...",5
284,I’ m not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time!,1
285,"I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn’ t include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so I had to re-do the pictures.",0
286,"I’ m not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAP!",1
287,"Yes, sir?",0
288,Can I have Mr. J. Smith paged? He said he'd be in the main dining room. I'm Mr. J. B. White.,0
289,"Who would you like to have paged again, sir?",0
290,Mr. J. Smith.,0
291,Where would you like him to come?,0
292,To the front desk.,0
293,"Just a moment, please.",0

297,"The best product is Techne, and you can buy either the lotion or cream.",0
298,Which one is best?,0
299,The cream form is very popular.,0
300,Can I do anything else to help with the itching?,0
301,You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker.,0
302,I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching.,0
303,"Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask.",0
304,Excuse me. Something is wrong with my bank card. Can you help me?,0
305,Yes. What's the problem?,0
306,"Just a mistake with my name. It should be issued as Steven, but the card is under the name ' Steven '.",0
307,"Oh, I am very sorry about that. It's our fault. I will arrange someone to correct it immediately.",0
308,"OK, no problem. To err is human.",0
309,"Anyway, we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you. Please just wait for a moment, and it will be fixed.",0
310,Thank you very much.,4
311,Is everything to your satisfaction?,0
312,"No, the steak was recommended, but it is not very fresh.",0
313,"Oh, sorry to hear that. This is quite unusual. I will look into the matter.",0
314,This is very annoying.,0
315,"I'm sorry, sir. Do you wish to try something else? That would be on the house, of course.",0
316,"No, I don't risk it.",0
317,"How about a delicious dessert then, with our compliment?",0
318,I'm not keen on dessert as a habit. They are fattening.,0
319,"I see, sir. I'm sure everything will be right next time you come.",0
320,"Excuse me, but I'm not feeling too well. I think I'm going to throw up.",0
321,There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you.,0
322,I must've missed it.,0
323,Is this your first time flying?,0
324,Yes. I'm going to San Francisco.,0
325,"Oh, it's a beautiful city. I think you'll like it.",0

381,We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan. The application process is pretty straight forward. I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment?,0
382,"Yes, I do. It's ready and waiting in my account.",0
383,"The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you, who are already contracted to us, so...",0
384,"Could I just stop you there? Sorry to interrupt, but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want.",0
385,That will certainly cut down the processing time. We can move on to the next step. Do you have the purchase price?,0
386,"Yes, it's 110,000 RIB. So, with the down payment done, I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB.",0
387,"What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form, ID card, proof of residency, proof of income, the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment.",0
388,"Yes, I have everything here. OK, I'll come in and see you later today. Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week! How exciting!",4
389,"Hi, my name is Tom.",0
390,"Tom, the new sales representative? Nice to meet you! I'm Melinda.",0
391,Nice to meet you too.Melinda.,0
392,"Now let me show you around. This is our reception area, and our conference room is right over there. Over here is the sales department.",0
393,"Really? This is a nice office, but it's quite small.",6
394,Yeah... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there.,0
395,It looks like you guys work hard.,0
396,"I tell you what just between you and me, we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding. Oh, your cubicle is over the. And this way. Those are all private offices the managers offices.",0
397,Hmm... Tell me more details about our jobs.,0
398,Sure thing.,0
399,What do you think of our price?,0
400,"Your price has gone up sharply, hasn't it?",0
401,"Yes. We regret we cannot maintain our original price. Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised, we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly.",0
402,"I agree with you there, but your price is unreasonable.",0
403,I don't think so. You must compare our price with that of other export houses. I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level.,0
404,"I don't think we'll be able to pay the price. To have this business concluded, you need to lower your price at least by 3 %.",0
405,I’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price.,0
406,"Don't you agree with me that in the long run, moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit?",0
407,We've already cut down our price to cost level.,0
408,Is that all?,0
409,"Yes, this is the best we can do.",0
410,I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered.,0
411,"So, Jimmy, how does it feel to have your own money?",0
412,"It’ s great, dad. I don’ t mind delivering papers, but the real fun is collecting the money.",4
413,"Even though you are only twelve, it’ s not too early to start saving a little money.",0
414,I’ Ve never had a bank account before. Why don’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does?,0
415,"You know you would spend it. And also, money in the bank earns interest.",0
416,But what if I need my money suddenly?,0
417,"The bank will give you a PIN, and you can withdraw money from any ATM.",0
418,Great! So it’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters!,0
419,Not quite. You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars. And sometimes the bank has service charges. But you don’ t have to worry about that yet. Let’ s go make your first depot,0
420,OK. Guess I have to do that before. I can make money my first withdrawal.,4
421,"Tony, could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job?",0
422,Working hours are from 8: 30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Be sure not to be late or absent. Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month.,0
423,Is there anything else? How about my salary?,0
424,"Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard. On the 20th day of every month, you can get your salary on time. Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record.",0
425,"Wow, thank you for telling me these. Do you mind telling me something else, like attendance record, holiday, and how to ask for leave?",0
426,"All new members are likely to ask the same questions. Haha. I can understand that. Every month you have three days off, besides the weekends and some important holidays. After you've been here for a year, you qualify for a one-week vacation. The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour, and more than a half-day should predict three days.",0
427,"Okay, that's good. I get it.",4
428,"Kate, you never believe what's happened.",6
429,What do you mean?,0
430,Masha and Hero are getting divorced.,0
431,You are kidding. What happened?,6
432,"Well, I don't really know, but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months, and filed for divorce.",0
433,That's really surprising. I always thought they are well matched. What about the kids? Who get custody?,6
434,"Masha, it seems quiet and makable, no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out.",0
435,"That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about. Well, I still can't believe it, Masha and Hero, the perfect couple. When would they divorce be final?",0
436,Early in the New Year I guess.,0
437,Overseas operator.,0
438,"I would like to make a collect call to Taipei, Taiwan, please.",0
439,"Your name, please.",0
440,Tim Chen.,0
441,"What's the number, please.",0
442,"The area code is 2, and the number is 2367-9960.",0
443,The line is connected. Please go ahead.,4
444,Hello. Excuse me.,0
445,Yes. Can I help you?,0
446,Do you remember me? I just had lunch here a half hour ago.,0
447,Of course I remember you.,0
448,I think I lost my wallet here.,0
449,"Oh, no. Really? I didn't see anything.",6
450,Really? You didn't find a wallet?,6
451,"No, I didn't. Would you like to go look by the table with me?",0
452,"Yes, I would. It's not here. And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left?",0
453,No. It's been empty the whole time.,0
454,Hmm. I don't know how it could have happened.,0
455,"I remember, sir, that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself, did you?",0
456,No. My friend did.,0
457,Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here?,0
458,"No, I'm not sure. But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it. So I usually put it next to me on the table.",0
459,Maybe you lost it before you came here. Or maybe you left it at home.,0
460,I don't think it's at home. I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do?,0
461,"Well, the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then, if it isn't, you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards. Next, you need to replace whatever you lost, your driver's license, things like that.",0
462,Should I call the police?,0
463,You can if you want. But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets.,0
464,Hmm. I'll go home and check. Maybe you're right. Maybe it's at home.,0
465,"I'm sorry we couldn't find it, sir.",0
466,Thanks for your help.,0
467,"Good morning, young lady. You can call me Ma. Do you see anything you like?",0
468,Yes. Many things! I especially love this beautiful quilt.,4
469,That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland.,0
470,It sounds like a special quilt. Why do you want to sell it?,4
471,"Well, this home is too big for me now, so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller. Therefore, I need to part with a few things.",0
472,"Oh, I see. Umm, how much do you want for the quilt?",0
473,Is fifteen dollars OK?,0
474,"May I come in, Mr Sun?",0
475,"I’ d rather you didn’ t, Miss Yang. I’ m very busy now.",0
476,Can I try later then?,0
477,"Yes, of course.",0
478,"Is it all right for me to come in now, Mr Sun?",0
479,"Well, uh... I’ m still pretty busy, but... all right. Come in. What can I do for you?",0
480,Do you mind if I sit down?,0
481,Not at all. Take a seat. Now what can I do for you?,0
482,I want to leave the department. Do you think I could put info a transfer?,0
483,Yes. But why should you want to do that?,0
484,Do you mind if I speak frankly?,0
485,Not at all. Go ahead.,0
486,"Well. You see, I don’ t like the office. I don’ t like the staff. And I’ m afraid of you. And I don’ t want to go one. So may I put info a transfer?",0
487,Yes. I’ d be delighted if you did.,0
488,Where is that?,0
489,"Take me to the airport, please.",0
490,Are you in a hurry?,0
491,I have to be there before 17 o'clock.,0
492,We'll make it except a jam. You know it's rush hour.,0
493,There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time.,0
494,I'll do my best.,0
495,Here's twenty dollars.,0
496,Do you have small bills?,0
497,"No. If you can't break it, keep the change. But can you give me a receipt?",0
498,Here is your receipt. Thank you.,4
499,Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly.,0
500,When did you last time have your eyes checked?,0
501,Two years ago. At that time I had no problems.Now I can’ t even make out something ten meters away.,0
502,"Come over here. I will test your eyes. First cover your left eye like this, and when I point, please read the chart from the top, and go as far as you can, telling me which way the “ E ” points.",0
503,All right.,0
504,Good.Now the other eye.,0
505,"Well, this one is worse.",0
506,"Never mind, just read as far as you can.",0
507,I can only read the first three lines.,0
508,"Oh, come on, Ultraman!",1
509,"What's up, Bro? What's in the bulletin?",0
510,It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p. m. to 7 p. m. in our neighborhood today.,0
511,Blackout? Even the TV has the limit.,0
512,Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout?,0
513,"Oops, no, Daddy can't watch American Idol, either!",1
514,"That's not the point. Come on, can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day?",0
515,"Oh, my god! No air-conditioner!",3
516,"OK, since you are the smart one, can you come up with a better plan? So that we won't be baked like cookies here.",0
517,How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood?,0
518,"Barbie? You know, I might be seven, but I'm not a girl.",0
519,Do you have a better plan?,0
520,"All right, all right.",0
521,"Yes, ma'am, how could I help you?",0
522,I am wondering if you do facial care?,0
523,"Yes, we do.",0
524,How much would it be?,0
525,From 200 to 800.,0
526,I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me. Could you recommend something around 300?,0
527,No problem.,0
528,"Can I help you, Miss?",0
529,I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars. We want office-style cabinets in white. The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356.,0
530,How soon do you want it?,0
531,Could you deliver it tomorrow?,0
532,No problem.,0
533,Please handle the items carefully.,0
534,Certainly.,0
535,We will pay by collect on delivery.,0
536,Hello! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers?,0
537,"Well, Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here.",0
538,First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information.,0
539,The position calls for a person with some working experience. We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills. Can you deliver your resume to us first?,0
540,Of course. I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time. I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.,0
541,OK. I will call you soon. Bye now.,0
542,Bye.,0
543,"Just as the saying goes, every potter praises his own pot. You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview.",0
544,It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time.,0
545,"You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance, in order to have a good performance in the interview.",0
546,The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background. And the length depends on the particular situation.,0
547,"Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in, can you make a targeted preparation.",0
548,"To sell yourself successfully, you should leave the interviewer a deep impression.",0
549,"Selling yourself should go straight to the point, and the statement should be clear and brief.",0
550,It should also be truthful and realistic. Do not blindly blow your own horn.,0
551,You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for.,0
552,"While you should not omit your weak points, they need to be described appropriately",0
553,"Time permitted, you could add certain examples to your description.",0

556,"Hi, Deborah! This is John. I'm calling from Australia.",0
557,What are you doing in Australia?,0
558,I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week. Remember?,0
559,"Oh, right. What time is it there?",0
560,"It's 10:00 P. M. And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles, right?",0
561,Yes - four o'clock in the morning.,0
562,4:00 A. M.? I'm really sorry.,4
563,That's OK. I'm awake now.,4
564,"Hello. May I speak to Jerry, please?",0
565,"Sorry, but he is out for lunch right now.",5
566,I see. Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back?,0

569,"My pleasure, bye!",4
570,"Excuse me, Miss.",0
571,What can I do for you?,0
572,I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed.,0
573,What's your flight number?,0
574,Flight CA216 to Chengdu.,0
575,"Yes, it's true. It has been delayed.",0
576,Could you please tell me why?,0
577,"Yes, of course. The delay is due to heavy rain.",0
578,How long will the delay be? Do you have any further information about it?,0
579,"I am sorry, we don't know the extent of the delay at present. But according to the latest weather forecast, there will be a change in weather soon.",0
580,"We have to wait. Well, is it possible for the rain to stop before noon?",0
581,It's hard to say. Weather is so changeable in the summer. Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight.,0
582,"Yes, I will. Thanks a lot. Bye!",0
583,Bye,0
584,What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch. I'm stuck!,1
585,"I'm worried, Tom. I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour.",0
586,I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!,1
587,I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here?,0
588,I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.,0
589,"Well, now we're stuck. What can we do?",0
590,I don't know.,0
591,"I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy.",0
592,What do you mean?,0
593,"We're stranded here, Tom. We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.",0
594,I have plenty of gas.,0
595,"Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze.",0
596,So what can we do?,0
597,"Turn the lights off.Then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible.",0
598,Alright. That's a good idea.,4
599,I wish we hadn't come up here. Now we'll probably be here for days.,0
600,Days?,0
601,"Yes, it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms. People get stranded for days.",0
602,"Oh, my God! It's good we have food.",6
603,Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes. Then we'll turn it on again.,0
604,"Hey, buddy, can’ t you see there’ s a line?",0
605,"Oh, sorry. I didn’ t know.",5
606,What? You haven’ t taken the bus before?,0
607,"No, I’ m afraid not.",5
608,"Well, you have to wait in line like everyone else. Besides, you should let old people on first.",0
609,Sorry.,0
610,It’ s all right. Where are you going?,0
611,I wanted to see the White House.,0
612,"Oh, well you don’ t want this bus, anyway. It goes to Georgetown.",0
613,"Oh, no.",0
614,"It’ s all right, though. Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A.",0
615,"Oh, well thank you very much.",4
616,You’ re welcome.,4
617,Can I help you?,0
618,"I'd like the double cheese burger meal, please.",0
619,What kind of drink would you like with that?,0
620,Just coke will be fine.,0
621,"Would you like a super size meal? Only 2 RIB more, you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium. And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes.",0
622,"That sounds good, thanks, I'd like that. Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke, thanks.",4
623,"That's not a problem, Miss. Will that be it?",0
624,"Yes, that's all.",0
625,"That will be 25RMB, please",0
626,You got it.,0
627,I would like to purchase some meat.,0
628,What kind of meat would you like to get today?,0
629,"First off, I'm going to need a pound of ground beef.",0
630,A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48.,0
631,That's perfect.,0
632,What else will you be needing?,0
633,I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts.,0
634,The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound.,0
635,What's the total price for the chicken?,0
636,It's going to be $ 12.15.,0
637,"Okay, I think that will be all for me today.",4
638,I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks.,0
639,"Yes, Mr. Bergeron. You mentioned that in your letter. To tell you the truth, your proposal surprised us.",0
640,"Is that so? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person, so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration. Our firm specializes in this line of business. We have six sales representatives, who are on the road all the time, covering the whole of the European market.",6
641,Do you sell direct to shops?,0
642,"Yes, we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts. We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct, without any middlemen.",0
643,Do you keep a stock of these things?,0
644,"In some cases, such as the wristwatches, which always have a steady market, we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents. Generally, however, we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply. We are paid for our service, of course.",0
645,"That is, your commission.",0
646,"Yes, our commission is very reasonable. We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal.",0
647,Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission.,0
648,"The European market is not familiar with your products. You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs. A 10 % commission will not leave us much.",0
649,"According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course?",0
650,"We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with.",0
651,"We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market...",0
652,Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?,0
653,"Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover. Besides our price is worked out according to the costing. A 10 % commission means an increase in our price. We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect.",0
654,"Oh, that's just too bad. I intended to make great efforts in selling your products.",0
655,"Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples. Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products, can we then discuss further details.",0
656,"Ah, Mrs. Miller, but in this case am I covered?",0
657,"Oh, yes. We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction.",0
658,"All right, but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair. And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency.",0
659,Very good. We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair.,0
660,Have you worked out the offers. Mr. Thou?,0
661,"Yes, we have. Here's our CIF quotation sheet. Please have a careful look.",0
662,Are the prices on the list firm offers?,0
663,Yes. All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation.,0
664,I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices.,0
665,"All these products are our best-selling lines. The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand. And we are always open to negotiate, especially on larger orders. What do you have in mind?",0
666,How long does your offer remain valid? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan.,0
667,I understand. Our offer remains open for 4 days.,0
668,"Hello sir, may I help you?",0
669,"Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.",0
670,"I see. Well, you have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.",0
671,"Sounds good. I don’ t want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.",4
672,"We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.",0
673,What about Wi-fi?,0
674,Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.,0
675,One last thing. Is it waterproof?,0
676,We have been over this a hundred times! We are not getting a pet!,1
677,Why not? Come on! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty!,1
678,Who is going to look after a dog or a cat?,0
679,"I will! I’ ll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard!",1
680,"What if we want to take a vacation? Who will we leave it with? Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.",0
681,Ok. How about we get a cat or a ferret?,0
682,"We’ re planning on having children soon, I don’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.",0
683,Fine! Let’ s get a bird then! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk! A parrot would be awesome!,0
684,"I’ ll tell you what, I can get you some hamsters and we’ ll take it from there.",0
685,Yay!,4
686,"Good evening, Mr. Lee and thank you for choosing our airline. We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked. Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat?",0
687,Overbooked? Give up my seat? I don’ t understand.,0
688,From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft. That’ s overbooked.,0
689,"I know what overbooked is, I just don’ t understand how that could happen?",0
690,"Actually it’ s a common practice to overbook, as passengers often don’ t take their flight as scheduled. Most of the time there is no problem but today, more passengers arrived than we have seats,",0
691,So who has to stay behind?,0
692,"Well, first we ask for volunteers. If someone like yourself volunteers, they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year. If no one volunteers we just have to select someone.",0
693,Ok. I’ ll volunteer. I could use a free ticket!,0
694,I want to rent this apartment.,0
695,I’ m glad to hear that.,4
696,How much are you asking?,0
697,You will have to pay $ 1050 every month.,0
698,I can’ t afford that.,0
699,What can you afford?,0
700,I was thinking $ 800 a month.,0

792,What ever you say?,0
793,Am I ever hungry? When will supper be ready?,0
794,It's almost ready. Can you set the table?,0

1413,"You drive a hard bargain! OK, that's a deal.",0
1414,I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure. I realized that I might have left my watch.,5
1415,"Yes, Ma'am. May I have your name and room number?",0
1416,My name is Terry. I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132.,0
1417,What kind of watch is it?,0
1418,It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch.,0
1419,"Yes, we have it.",0
1420,"Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel?",4
1421,What are your thoughts on the apartment?,0
1422,I think that it’ s absolutely gorgeous.,4
1423,There aren’ t any problems with the apartment?,0
1424,"I think that the apartment looks very nice, but I do see some problems.",0
1425,What problems?,0
1426,I did notice a few stains in the carpet.,0
1427,We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in.,0
1428,You will?,0
1429,"Yes, but other than that, are there any more problems?",0
1430,That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment.,0
1431,I’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing.,4
1432,It is. I love it.,4
1433,"That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful. Would you show it to me, please?",0
1434,Absolutely. Here it is.,0
1435,Could I try it on?,0
1436,"Please do, the fitting-room is over there.",0
1437,It feels a little tight around the waist. Do you have a bigger one?,0
1438,I'm sorry. We don't have this color in your size. We have some green ones in your size. Would you please have a look at this green one?,0
1439,OK. How much does it cost?,0
1440,It's 486 yuan.,0
1441,"Mrs. Wang, would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable?",0
1442,"As I said before, your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid. We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap.",0
1443,"Just to comply, we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent. I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling.",0
1444,So do we. Certainly it's a step forward on your side. But the gap is still too wide.,0
1445,"The ball is in your court, Mrs.Wang. What price would you suggest?",0
1446,"To make your offer workable, I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken.",0
1447,"That won't do. You see, our profit margin is very narrow. It simply can't stand such a big cut.",0
1448,"I hate to disappoint you, Mr. Brown, but if that's the case, we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere. Do think it over, please. We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion.",0
1449,"Well, I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction. Would you mind waiting a day or two, until I get a reply from the home office?",0
1450,"Not at all. Shall we meet again, say, on Friday morning?",0
1451,Good. Friday morning at 9.,0
1452,Good morning.,0
1453,Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please?,0
1454,I’ m sorry She isn’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her?,5
1455,Thank you.But I will call her later,4
1456,OK.Goodbye.,4
1457,Goodbye.,4
1458,"We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now, and there still isn't a bus in sight.",0
1459,I'm afraid we'll be late for the party.,0
1460,"Have you got the time, Tom?",0
1461,"Yes, my watch says a quarter to seven. but there is something wrong with my watch!",1
1462,But you bought it only last month.,0
1463,"Yes, but ever since I bought it, it gains about five minutes a day, so I ' Ve got to have it repaired.",0
1464,How long will it take us to get there?,0
1465,I think about ten minutes by bus.,0
1466,"It's not far away, then. Let's walk, it's beginning to rain.",0
1467,Wait! I think I see a bus coming now. Let's hope it's the No. 22 bus.,0
1468,"Hi, Mr. Smith. I'm Doctor Hawkins. Why are you here today?",0
1469,I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.,0
1470,"Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.",0
1471,"I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?",0
1472,"Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.",0
1473,Ok.,0
1474,"Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?",0
1475,Yes.,0
1476,"Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.",0
1477,"I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.",0
1478,"Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.",0
1479,"Ok, thanks doctor.",0
1480,Good afternoon. Mr. Tylor's office?,0
1481,I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension.,0
1482,"I'm sorry, but could you please transfer this call to Mr. Tylor's office?",0
1483,"Sure, please hold on.",0
1484,Thank you.,0
1485,"Now Mr. Tylor's on the line. Go ahead, please.",0
1486,"You are so kind, you helped me a lot.",4
1487,You are welcome. Bye!,4
1488,"Good afternoon, Lexington Software. Angelina Dawson, how can I help?",0
1489,"Hello, this is Quinn from IBA.",0
1490,"Ah, hello Quinn. Oh dear, you are calling to tell me there is a problem, aren't you?",0
1491,"I'm afraid so, yes.",0
1492,"Hmm... well, it was my first attempt! Is it a very big mistake, or can we just alter it?",0
1493,Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake.,0
1494,What do you recommend we do?,0
1495,I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible.,0
1496,"I trust your judgement. Thank you, Quinn. I'll be back tomorrow with a new set. Bye for now.",0
1497,Oh!!! I have a horrible toothache.,0
1498,You should go to the dentist.,0
1499,I hate dentists.,0
1500,"Well, suffer then. If you have a toothache, you have to go to the dentist.",0
1501,It always hurts. I hate going.,0
1502,"Stop being such a baby. If it really hurts that much, just let them knock you out.",0
1503,"O. K., O. K., I’ ll go.",0
1504,Good. You'll feel better after you do.,0
1505,"Hi, I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels, please.",0
1506,"Certainly sir, this is our train schedule. We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm.",0
1507,How long does it take to get there?,0
1508,"About twelve hours. We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train. If you’ d like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive.",0
1509,"Yeah, I think that is the best option. Do you serve food on the train? Twelve hours is such a long time!",0
1510,"Yes, of course. There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times. We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.",0
1511,Great! I’ ll take it.,4
1512,Here you are sir. Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot. Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train!,0
1513,I understand. Thank you very much!,0
1514,Have a great trip.,4
1515,I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.,0
1516,A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?,0
1517,The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.,0
1518,So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?,0
1519,It sounds like it will be.,0
1520,I really hope it doesn't get cold.,0
1521,"That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.",0
1522,"The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.",0
1523,That is true. The weather is constantly changing.,0
1524,It would be nice if the weather would never change.,0
1525,"That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.",0
1526,True. Predictable weather would make life easier.,0
1527,Do you eat a lot of healthy food?,0
1528,"Compared with healthy food, unhealthy food just tastes so much better. And anyway, I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active, you can get away with eating whatever you like. It's all in the mind.",0
1529,"You have the point. I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume. Some good things you should try are cranberry juice, wild rice and yoghurt.",0
1530,What's special about these things?,0
1531,"Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic. Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice. Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein, vitamins and is also acidic. People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day, your guts will be much more settled.",0
1532,Thanks. I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now.,4
1533,"I've been so tired recently. I've been trying, but I don't think I'm up to this job.",5
1534,"You need to take a break, maybe a vacation.",0
1535,"Oh, yes, indeed. I've run out of steam. To be honest, I want to be in a different environment.",5
1536,Is that so?,6
1537,"Yes, I don't want to be stuck in a rut. I want to move on.",0
1538,Have you decided?,0
1539,Yes. I want to get a better job.,0
1540,Could you tell me why you want to quit?,0
1541,I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues.,0
1542,"Oh, that's terrible. Do you want to get a higher salary in our company?",0
1543,I'm afraid not. I've promised my girlfriend. We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay.,0
1544,"OK, I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you. However, I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.",0
1545,Thank you so much for your advice.,0
1546,And every best wish for your new job.,0
1547,Thank you.,0
1548,The train is leaving. Hurry up! Which car are we in?,0
1549,"Let me see. Oh, No. 11.",0
1550,"Here we are, Car 11. Let's get in.",0
1551,Seats No. 20 and 21. It’ s nice that we’ Ve got a window seat.,0
1552,Let's put our suitcases on the rack.,0
1553,"Oh, the baggage rack is full. Put them under the seat for the time being.",0
1554,All right.,0
1555,"So, how should we get to the theatre?",0
1556,Let's take the bus.,0
1557,"I hate the bus system in London! The bus drivers are rude, the buses are never on time, and there are few people around who can help you.",1
1558,It's not that bad. You probably just had a bad experience once.,0
1559,"It wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.",1
1560,"We could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.",0
1561,"Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too.",0
1562,"If we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show. Should we take the bus?",0
1563,"We're already late, so I think we had better take a taxi.",0
1564,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.,0
1565,Fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.,0
1566,It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes. don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you.,0
1567,"Thanks, that was nice of you.",4
1568,"See, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!",0
1569,Let's go over this plan again.,0
1570,"From Vancouver, we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg.",0
1571,"And that is mostly flat, right?",0
1572,"Relatively, once we're out of Alberta, anyway. Then it's hills again in Aitoba.",0
1573,"And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto, right?",0
1574,That's right. And up in to Quebec. And that's where we stop.,0
1575,"It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long, long ride.",0
1576,Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime?,0
1577,"Good morning, sir. What can I do for you?",0
1578,I'm Bill. I'm in Room 908. Can you change the room for me? It's too noisy. My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made. She said it was too much for her.,1
1579,"I'm awfully sorry, sir. I do apologize. Room 908 is at the end of the corridor. It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet.",0
1580,"Anyhow, I'd like to change our room.",0
1581,"No problem, sir. We'll manage it, but we don't have any spare room today. Could you wait till tomorrow? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning. There'll be some rooms for you to choose from.",0
1582,All right. I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep.,0
1583,"Be sure. I'll make a note of that. Everything will be taken care of. And if there is anything more you need, please let us know.",0
1584,It's time for bed.,0
1585,I'm not ready to go to sleep. I'm not tired.,0
1586,"It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow.",0
1587,I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.,0
1588,Why don't you try counting sheep?,0
1589,I've tried that before. It really doesn't work.,0
1590,"That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed.",0
1591,Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?,0
1592,"If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night.",0
1593,I promise I'll go to sleep soon.,0
1594,"No, you're going to sleep now, so good night.",0
1595,See you in the morning.,4
1596,"I see myself as being honest, diligent, persevering and creative. And I have a strong sense of responsibility.",0
1597,How about your psychological resilience?,0
1598,"I think I can work well under pressure, if necessary.",0
1599,How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with?,0
1600,"I will just be sincere and friendly to others, and I believe they will treat me the same way.",0
1601,You seem to be a kind-hearted lady.,0
1602,Thank you. I simply believe the goodness of human nature.,0
1603,Please tell me your weaknesses if you can.,0
1604,I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details. I am always in pursuit of perfection.,0
1605,I need some mascara. Do you have good thickening mascara?,0
1606,Of course. Here is our thickening mascara. We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes.,0
1607,Alright. And I want to consider your eye shadow too. Do you have a color chart can look at?,0
1608,We have a very wide selection of colors. And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin. So it is very gentle on your eyelids. Would you like to sample some?,0
1609,"Oh, sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first.",0
1610,I can help you with that.,0
1611,Thank you.,4
1612,Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256?,0
1613,"Yes, we are on the same plane.",0
1614,But I am a transfer passenger. I have a connecting flight to Miami.,0
1615,So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area.,0
1616,Yes.It ' s quite troublesome.,0
1617,Why not go and find a porter?,0
1618,"Billy, you don’ t look too well. Maybe you should take the day off school.",0
1619,But Mom! Today we’ re playing football! I love football!,0
1620,You’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever. What’ s that on your arm?,0
1621,I don’ t know. It was there when I woke up this morning.,0
1622,It’ s rash. I’ d better take you to see the doctor. How did you get that bruise on your leg?,0
1623,I bashed it against the chair in my room.,0
1624,Does it hurt?,0
1625,"A little, but not much.",0
1626,Here. Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down. I’ ll take you to the doctor’ s after breakfast.,0
1627,"If I’ m better this afternoon, can I go to school?",0
1628,"If you are better, but I doubt you will be.",0
1629,"My name is Mary, and I will be your waitress tonight.",0
1630,"Thank you, Mary. We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant.",4
1631,"Before your main course, would you like to order an appetizer?",0
1632,"Sure, that sounds great. Where are your appetizers listed?",4
1633,There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table.,0
1634,The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good. Is that pretty good?,0
1635,"You know, that is one of my favorites!",4
1636,"OK, I'll take one order of that.",0
1637,You could choose another appetizer for half price to share.,0
1638,Perfect! Please add on an order of onion rings.,4
1639,"I would like to speak to you, if you don’ t mind.",0
1640,What would you like to speak to me about?,0
1641,I would like to talk to you about this year’ s election.,0
1642,Is that right?,0
1643,I am a volunteer for this year’ s campaign.,0
1644,That’ s wonderful. I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand.,0
1645,"I know history is about to be made, and I would like to be a part of it.",0
1646,That’ s fantastic.,0
1647,Are you planning on voting?,0
1648,I’ m going to vote.,0
1649,Go to your polling place early on Election Day.,0
1650,I will. Good luck with your volunteering.,4
1651,"Hello, Steven. How do you get along with your job?",0
1652,"Actually, I learn many things from it. I find that I am a quick learner in new things.",0
1653,"Practice makes perfect. By the way, what do you learn from your job?",0
1654,"At first I didn't know anything about the machine. Now I know how to operate it. Besides, the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement.",0
1655,"Yeah, you are a good learner. I must commend you for your good performance.",4
1656,Thank you. That's a long way to go for my job.,4
1657,I appreciate your effort very much. The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work.,0
1658,"OK, let's go.",0
1659,Where on earth are we?,0
1660,"Judging by all the traffic, I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city.",0
1661,What did I do wrong? Did I take a wrong turn?,0
1662,"I'm not sure, but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge.",0
1663,"Well, now we should turn back a few kilometres.",0
1664,It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map.,0
1665,Hello. Front desk.,0
1666,Yes. This is Bob Robinson. I’ m calling from room number 627.,0
1667,"Hi, Bob. What can I do for you?",0
1668,Is it possible to change to another room?,0
1669,Could you please tell me why?,0
1670,My room is facing the swimming pool. It’ s noisy for me. I have a problem sleeping. And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator.,0
1671,So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor.,0
1672,You’ re right.,0
1673,Okay. Let me check for a room on the first floor.,0
1674,Thank you.,0
1675,I’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor. How about room 108?,0
1676,That’ s fine. Can I move now?,0
1677,Sure. I’ ll send the bellman to help you.,0
1678,"Oh, thank you kindly.",4
1679,You’ re welcome.,4
1680,What are you doing here today?,0
1681,I would like to fight my ticket.,0
1682,Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?,0
1683,"Yes, the officer is here today.",0
1684,What's your case?,0
1685,"I was pulled over for running a red light, but I never did.",0
1686,Do you believe that the officer lied?,0
1687,"There was a camera on the signal. So, he was obviously lying.",0
1688,Your license plate was caught on camera?,0
1689,A picture of my license plate was never taken.,0
1690,"Since there is no picture of your license plate on record, I'm going to let you go.",0
1691,Thank you. I'm glad that you believe me.,4
1692,"Hey Joe, what are you doing in this department store?",0
1693,"Hi, Rita, I'm just looking for a pair of shoes. I won't be here for long.",0
1694,"Why not? When I go shoe shopping, I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices.",0
1695,That's my problem. I don't have a lot of options.,0
1696,"What do you mean? This is a big store, isn't it?",0
1697,"Yes, but I have unusually big feet. That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide, and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into.",0
1698,"So how do you usually go about buying shoes, then?",0
1699,"Well, first of all, I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection.",0
1700,"Well, you're in the right store. If they don't have it, no one will.",0
1701,"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me. I prefer white, so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. Since I’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.",0
1702,what shall we do after the volleyball match?,0
1703,how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look? I remember there is one in the gym.,0
1704,that's a good idea. I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family.,4
1705,"me, too. What did you have in mind?",0
1706,"I haven't decided yet, but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must.",0
1707,"I agree. They're very lovely, especially "" Huan Huan "".",4
1708,"is that the red one? That is my favorite, too. Do you know how much they are?",0
1709,"the five dolls are sold together as a set, and they're priced according to the size. The bigger they are the more expensive.",0
1710,"oh, I see. If I buy more than a set, can I get any discount?",0
1711,I don't think so. All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now.,0
1712,any other ideas?,0
1713,"there are lots of things, such as postcards, key chains, posters and various arts and crafts.",0
1714,it all sounds great. We can go there after the match. I can't wait to see what they have.,4
1715,Mom! I hate eating vegetables!,1
1716,You don’ t have to eat them. I don’ t mind.,0
1717,Thanks mom! Can I have dessert now? I love chocolate cake!,0
1718,No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables.,0
1719,But I don’ t like them! It’ s not fair!,1
1720,"You can have some fruit for dessert. If you eat an apple and a banana, I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake.",0
1721,"Ok... actually, I don’ t mind eating peas and carrots, buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower.",0
1722,"I’ ll remember that for next time. You’ ll get extra peas and carrots, buy no broccoli or cauliflower. OK?",0
1723,Thanks mom!,4
1724,It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place. It gave me a good idea of your product range.,0
1725,"It’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers. What’ s your general impression, may I ask?",0
1726,"Very impressive, indeed, especially the speed of your NW Model.",0
1727,That’ s our latest development. A product with high performance. We put it on the market just two months ago.,0
1728,"The machine gives you an edge over your competitors, I guess.",0
1729,Certainly. No one can match us as far as speed is concerned.,0
1730,Could you give me some brochures for that machine? And the price if possible.,0
1731,Right. Here is our sales catalog and literature.,0
1732,Thank you. I think we may be able to work together in the future.,4
1733,Is the factory fully-automated?,0
1734,Not completely. Our production process is partially-automated. We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually.,0
1735,What about supply of parts to the production line?,0
1736,"Well, the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system. And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line.",0
1737,What about the smaller components?,0
1738,They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory.,0
1739,I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee.,4
1740,"Yeah, you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates.",0
1741,That's not why. This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing.,0
1742,I guess. Don't you have reunions in Taiwan?,0
1743,Definitely. Every year. But just for our forty-person class.,0
1744,Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year.,0
1745,How many languages can you speak?,0
1746,"Besides Chinese, I can speak English and French.",0
1747,You mean you can read and write both of them?,0
1748,"No, I can only carry on a simple conversation in French.",0
1749,Can you read and write English well?,0
1750,I can speak the language better than read and write.,0
1751,Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries?,0
1752,I think so. I used to be an interpreter.,0
1753,Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work?,0
1754,The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work. I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm.,0
1755,Are you ready to go shopping?,0
1756,Just a minute. I need to make a list of thinks that we need.,0
1757,"Good idea. Have you written down potatoes, carrots, and onions?",0
1758,I don’ t have onions on my list. I’ ll add them. We should get some tea. Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get?,0
1759,Let’ s get both. We need some coffee too. Is that on your list?,0
1760,"Yes, it is. Here’ s my list. Is there anything that I’ Ve forgotten?",0
1761,I think you’ Ve got everything. I want to got some chocolate and some cheese.,0
1762,What kind of cheese do you want.,0
1763,"I’ m not sure. I’ ll decide at the cheese counter, when I can see what they have. Have we got enough money?",0
1764,"We don’ t have enough cash, so I’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that. Where are the car keys?",0
1765,I’ Ve got them there. Shall I drive?,0
1766,How many years have you done business with China?,0
1767,"Let me see, about five years, we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003.",0
1768,Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete?,0
1769,"I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners. They have always followed the contract strictly. We can do business directly with the corporation. As I mentioned before, the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law. Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies.",0
1770,"Well, it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma. Does it influence your business in China?",0
1771,Actually not at present. But we are afraid it will. You know policies influence business to some extent. I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists. China is really a large market. We don't want to lose it.,0
1772,Thank you.,0
1773,You're welcome.,0
1774,"Give me a pack of first-class stamps, please.",0
1775,Here you are. That will be five dollars. Anything else?,0
1776,Yes. I want some post cards and some airmail stamps. I want to send some letters to South America.,0
1777,"Just a moment, I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America.",0
1778,"Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia? Also, I what to know how long it will take.",0
1779,Do you have the package with you? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost.,0
1780,Do you insure package?,0
1781,Yes. All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for.,0
1782,Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package?,0
1783,"The post office rarely loses package. You can, however, request a rectum receipt.",0
1784,One last question-what are your hours?,0
1785,We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon.,0
1786,"Thank you, you helped me a lot.",4
1787,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to interview me.",0
1788,"Hi there, I’ m Bill Gotcha, the owner of Gotcha Enterprises. Did you find your way here OK?",0
1789,Your assistant gave wonderful directions.,0
1790,Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career?,0
1791,Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States.,0
1792,What are you best at?,0
1793,I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems.,0
1794,What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills?,0
1795,I don’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy.,0
1796,That is good to hear!,4
1797,Good morning. SRC international. How may I help you?,0
1798,Good morning. I'd like to speak to Peter. Chen Please.,0
1799,Certainly. Who should I say is calling?,0
1800,This is Tim. Hunter from Hunter industries.,0
1801,And what is it regarding please?,0
1802,We have an appointment for this afternoon. Mr. Chen will know why I'm calling.,0
1803,"Of course, Please hold the line Mr. Hunter.",0
1804,"Right, let me run through your options. You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to, but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan.",0
1805,"OK, what does that entail?",0
1806,"It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember, your certificate is due in 2 months. If you can hold on to it, it'll be much better for your finances.",0
1807,"Yes, it does seem a little silly to cash it now. I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB. Will that be a problem?",0
1808,"Not at all, Mr Zu. As the certificate is due in 2 months, you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate.",0
1809,"I'm glad you thought of this. I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest, right?",4
1810,"Exactly right. If you'd like to go ahead, I can process that for you now, Mr Zu.",0
1811,"Absolutely, Jenny. Thanks very much, I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today.",4
1812,My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape.,0
1813,I just got it at the special health store. It's for my flabby arms.,0
1814,Let me know how it works.,0
1815,"I have to say, I have had enough of this roller coaster.",0
1816,I know what you mean. I'm like a yo-yo.,0
1817,Last week I was down to 60 kilos. This week I had one donut more. Now I'm up to 62 kilos.,0
1818,"May I have a menu, please?",0
1819,Of course.,0
1820,Could you tell me how this thing is cooked?,0
1821,Lobster? It is steamed and served with our special sauce.,0
1822,Is it good?,0
1823,Sure. It is a most popular dish.,0
1824,"I think I will try some lobster, and give me some green salad together.",0
1825,"Can’ t you come in and have tea now, Peter?",0
1826,"Not yet, I must water the garden first.",0
1827,Do you have to water it now?,0
1828,I’ m afraid I must. Look at it! It’ s terribly dry.,0
1829,What a nuisance!,2
1830,"Last summer it was very dry, too. Don’ t you remember? I had to water it every day.",0
1831,"Well, I’ ll have tea by myself. That was quick! Have you finished already?",0
1832,"Yes, Look out of the window.",0
1833,It’ s raining. That means you needn’ t water the garden.,0
1834,"That was a pleasant surprise. It means I can have tea, instead.",4
1835,"I'm broke, and I have to catch another bus.",0
1836,Why don't you have any money for another bus?,0
1837,I got hungry and bought some chips.,0
1838,That was smart.,0
1839,"Anyway, do you have any change I can use for the bus?",0
1840,I don't have any.,0
1841,I don't know how I'm going to get home.,0
1842,Get a transfer from the bus driver.,0
1843,How much is a transfer?,0
1844,It doesn't cost anything.,0
1845,That's great! Thanks for your help.,4
1846,You know what? Don't mention it.,0
1847,"Hello, Anna. Come in and sit down.",0
1848,"Hello, doctor.",0
1849,What's the matter?,0
1850,I've got a backache.,0
1851,Do you often suffer from backache?,0
1852,"No, I don't. I've never had a bad one before.",0
1853,When did it start?,0
1854,About four days ago.,0
1855,"Well, go home and rest in bed for two days, then you'll feel better.",0
1856,Can you give me some medicine? It's very painful.,0
1857,"Yes, I'll give you some pills. Take one a time and three times a day, and come back in three days. If you don't feel...",0
1858,Welcome on board. May I see your boarding pass?,0
1859,Here you are.,0
1860,"Your seat is three, in the third row, near the window.",0
1861,Thank you. Where can I put my suitcase?,0
1862,Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat.,0
1863,"Everyone's attention, please. We are going to take off. Please fasten your belts.",0
1864,"You're here to make a deposit, is that correct?",0
1865,"Right. I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account.",0
1866,"No problem. Could I have the cash and your Bank Book, please? Oh dear... there seems to be some problems here...",0
1867,What? What's wrong?,0
1868,"I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit. Look at this watermark, do you see it?",0
1869,"It does look a little strange, I didn't notice that before.",0
1870,"Hello, sir. Is there anything I can help you find?",0
1871,"Um... Uh... I'm just looking, thanks.",4
1872,Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife...,0
1873,"No, no, no. I'm just browsing. Thanks anyway.",4
1874,"Well, if you need anything, just ask.",0
1875,"Um... well, where's the men's shoe department?",0
1876,It's on the third floor. Turn left when you get off the escalator.,0
1877,Thanks.,4
1878,"I haven't told you what happened yet, have I?",0
1879,I haven't heard anything.,0
1880,"My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it.",4
1881,Are you serious?,6
1882,"Yes, I am really excited.",4
1883,That's great. Congratulations.,4
1884,I appreciate that.,4
1885,You have no idea how happy I am for you.,4
1886,For real?,6
1887,I believe you were the best choice for that promotion. I really do.,4
1888,I like Chinese food.,0
1889,"I like Chinese food, too. I like dumplings best.",4
1890,"At school, we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch.",0
1891,That's good. We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant.,4
1892,My mother can make some Chinese food.,0
1893,Really? That's wonderful!,4
1894,"OK. Come back into the classroom, class.",0
1895,"Does the class start again, Mam?",0
1896,"Yes, but to the heath, this break has last long enough.",0
1897,"Oh, breaktime flies.",5
1898,"come on, baby. It’ s time now.",0
1899,"Mam, another minute, could I?",0
1900,"Hurry up, little boy.",0
1901,"What's the matter, sir? You look pale.",0
1902,I feel dizzy and weak. And I'm having this pain in my ear. I think I am sick.,0
1903,Are you often traveling by plane?,0
1904,"No, this is the second time.",0
1905,That's right. It's normal if you don't often take the plane. Just relax a little bit.,0
1906,Why this happens to me when I am on the plane? I feel bad.,0
1907,"Don't worry, sir. It's just because of the lower pressure.",0
1908,What should I do about it?,0
1909,You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts.,0
1910,"OK, thanks. Does it work really? I'll give a try.",0
1911,Are you feeling better now? Do you need some pills?,0
1912,Much better. Thank you. I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep.,0
1913,"So, you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well.",0
1914,I am not used to wearing that. Thanks.,0
1915,"If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time, you'll feel more comfortable. So please try to sleep, and have meals according to Los Angeles's time.",0
1916,Thank you so much.,0
1917,Could I see the manager please? I have a complaint to make.,0
1918,"Yes, I’ m the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam?",0
1919,Did you have the room checked before we move in?,0
1920,Which room are you in?,0
1921,1808. The toilet doesn’ t work properly ; the water doesn’ t run in the shower.,0
1922,I’ m awfully sorry to hear that. I’ ll turn to it right away.,5
1923,I would like to open an account please.,0
1924,Do you have any form of ID?,0
1925,I have my Tennis Club card. Is that good enough?,0
1926,I’ m afraid not. It has to be a passport or a valid driver’ s license.,0
1927,Oh... wait a minute... here’ s my driver’ s license.,0
1928,"OK, just fill in this application. You can sit over there. This brochure explains our services. We have free checking, and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card. There is no service",0
1929,"OK, I’ ll fill out the form and come right back.",0
1930,"Dear, can you drive me to the clinic?",0
1931,I'm afraid I can't.,5
1932,Why?,0
1933,"Well, my car won't start. I don't know what's the matter with it.",0
1934,Could it be the battery?,0
1935,"No, I don't think it could be. I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems.",0
1936,"Well, I suppose it could be the gas.",0
1937,"No, there is plenty of gas. I filled it up yesterday.",0
1938,Perhaps it's the starter then?,0
1939,"Yes, that's possible.",0
1940,"What do you reading, Linda?",0
1941,"I'm reading a novel, The mill on the floss, written by the famous novelist gorge alias.",0
1942,What's it about?,0
1943,"It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister, who live in the mill on the river floss. It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate, the book ends with them ha",0
1944,Is it difficult to understand?,0
1945,"Not really, i would consider it easy.",0
1946,"Besides novels, any other types literary works that you indulgence.",0
1947,I really like short stories.,0
1948,Have you read anything else besides literature?,0
1949,"Certainly I have. I like to read books on vary subjects, and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time. I don't want to idle away and waste my time.",0
1950,I agree. People who don't read are no better often people who can't read. I also agree that books are like food for the mind.,0
1951,Can I help you?,0
1952,"I'd like to have a look at your air conditioners. Hum, this one looks pretty good.",0
1953,"Yes, it’ s this summer’ s best-seller.",0
1954,And what about your customer service?,0
1955,We provide free delivery and installation.,0
1956,How long is the warranty?,0
1957,It is two-year and covers parts and service.,0
1958,Very good. I’ ll take it.,4
1959,Hmm. Let me try something.Wait. I have a reservation for someone named Sang here. But it's spelled J - A - N - G. It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G. It's for a Mr. C Sang.,0
1960,"Oh, that must be me! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good.",0
1961,"Yes, sometimes it happens, Ma'am. That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.",0
1962,It's okay. It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel?,0
1963,"Yes, of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p. m. So you still have about 45 minutes.",0
1964,Good.,0
1965,"Here is your key. Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there, down the hall.Enjoy your stay, Ma'am.",0
1966,Thank you.,0
1967,"Excuse me, I need to get to Cambridge today.",0
1968,Would you like to go by train or by bus?,0
1969,"I am not sure, which one is better?",0
1970,The bus is cheaper but also slower. It will take about two-and-a-half hours.,0
1971,And how long does the train take?,0
1972,"If you take the fast train, it will take about 50 minutes.",0
1973,Where do I catch the train?,0
1974,The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station. They run approximately every half hour. Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9.,0
1975,How do I get to King's Cross?,0
1976,The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross. The Underground station is just round the corner from here.,0
1977,Can you show me on the map?,0
1978,It is very easy. Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads. The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on.,0
1979,Thank you very much.,4
1980,You're welcome.,4
1981,Have you seen the sales report for last quarter? Who do you think is our digest threat?,0
1982,"From the numbers, it seems like Forest Inc. is our digest competitor... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market.",0
1983,"Le'Ban is the new kid on the block, it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon... With them on the scene, the competition is outthrough.",0
1984,here's information about our competitor's recent market activities...,0
1985,"Thanks, this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies. With competition this intense, we'll have to step up production even more. We need a price we can compete with.",0
1986,We're in a very competitive environment. It's sink or saimin this market.,0
1987,Better start swimming! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys. I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday... the competition never sleeps and neither should we.,0
1988,"Hello, this is Hilton Hotel. How may I help you?",0
1989,Hi. I would like to make a reservation on this Friday.,0
1990,"OK. What kind of room do you want? We have single rooms, twin rooms, double rooms and suites available on Friday.",0
1991,I want a single room with ocean view. Do you have one?,0
1992,Let me check. Yes.,0
1993,OK. I will take it.,0
1994,When do you check in? How long are you planning to stay? Do you have any special requirements?,0
1995,I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday. Please give me a room away from the elevator. I hate noises while I am sleeping.,0
1996,OK. No problem.,0
1997,We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this.,0
1998,OK. Let me send a memo around.,0
1999,"Schedule it for this afternoon, when Ken gets back.",0
2000,I don’ t think he’ s back today.,0
2001,"Oh, that’ s right. Go ahead anyways. I’ ll fill him in. We can’ t lose this order under any circumstances!",0
2002,"I know, it’ s a big one.",0
2003,The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us. We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid.,0
2004,Is there anything wrong?,0
2005,"We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you, but there are 40 not up to the standard.",0
2006,It's hard for us to believe it. Our instruments have been the best quality for years. Have you any reliable evidence?,6
2007,Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London. You may inspect the defective instruments personally,0
2008,"Well. According to the contract, we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments. We’ ll send our technicians to repair them.",0
2009,"Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard. You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract, as well as for the inspection fee.",0
2010,"I am sorry about the quality problem, but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee.",0
2011,All right. In that case we are still willing to do business with you.,0
2012,"Hi Bill, I saw your grandma yesterday.",0
2013,Oh where was that?,0
2014,I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track.,0
2015,Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods.,0
2016,"Well, it pays off for her. How old is she anyway?",0
2017,She will be 86 next month.,0
2018,That is truly amazing!,4
2019,The bathroom looks lovely. Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you?,4
2020,I did it myself. I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement. Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed. I’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too. I learnt a lot by doing it myself.,0
2021,"So, let’ s see. You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls. You’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries. The bath, shower, and washbasin are the same as before, aren’ t they?",0
2022,"Yes, they are. I gave them a good clean. They are in good condition and don’ t need to be replaced.",0
2023,How long did it take you to do the tiling.,0
2024,"As I hadn’ t done it before, I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet. Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening. Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles. Putting the cupboard up took about an hour, so it took me two days altogether.",0
2025,I think you’ Ve done a very good job. As least as good as a professional would do. Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom?,4
2026,"You’ ll be lucky! However, I’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself.",4
2027,"I'd like to see that pen, please.",0
2028,You mean this one?,0
2029,"No, the other one in the brown case.",0
2030,"Oh, this one... Here.",0
2031,May I try it?,0
2032,Sure.,0
2033,It's very smooth. I'll take it.,0
2034,Cash or charge?,0
2035,"Charge, please.",0
2036,I’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles.,0
2037,"We have the offer ready for you. Let me see... here it is. 100 cases Houston Bristles, 57 mm, at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram, C. I. F European Main Ports, for shipment in June 2001. The offer is valid for five days.",0
2038,"Why, your price has soared. It’ s almost 25 % higher than last year’ s. It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price.",0
2039,I’ m a little surprised to hear you say that. You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months. The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.,0
2040,I’ m afraid I can’ t agree with you there. I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we’ Ve received from other sources.,0
2041,But you must take the quality into consideration. Everyone in the trade knows that US’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries.,0
2042,"I agree that yours are of better quality. But there’ s competition from synthetic products, too. You can’ t very well ignore that. Prices for synthetic bristles haven’ t changed much over the years.",0
2043,"There’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses. That’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones. To be frank with you, if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us, we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price.",0
2044,"Well, we’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price. But I’ ll have to try, I suppose.",0
2045,Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University. I am here for the interview relating to my visa application.,0
2046,Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions?,0
2047,Of course not.,0
2048,Why do you want to go to the US?,0
2049,I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate.,0
2050,Will you get any kind of scholarship?,0
2051,Yes. The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself.,0
2052,"Hello, I'd like to open an account.",0
2053,Which account would you like to open?,0
2054,I'd like to open a savings account. What's the interest rate now?,0
2055,It is 3.2 %. You may earn a little interest on money.,0

2413,8: 00 Beijing time.,0
2414,How do I use this adhesive?,0
2415,This is a special adhesive for easing the pain. Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days.,0
2416,How do I use the lotion?,0
2417,"Apply some of the ointment, and rub it into the skin.",0
2418,"Well, thanks very much.",4
2419,Not at all.,0
2420,I've got a temperature and my stomach hurts.,0
2421,How long have you been feeling this way?,0
2422,It all started the day before yesterday.,0
2423,You seem to have picked up some kind of infection.,0
2424,What should I do?,0
2425,Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out.,0
2426,Did you clean your room today?,0
2427,"No, not yet.",0
2428,"Well, when were you planning on doing that?",0
2429,I'm going to clean it up later.,0
2430,Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier?,0
2431,I'm going to clean it.,0
2432,"I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything.",0
2433,I know. I'll do it.,0
2434,Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else.,0
2435,"I'm not going anywhere until later, so I'll clean it then.",0
2436,"Hello, can I help?",0
2437,I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C.,0
2438,I have it right here.,0
2439,Great. Can I take it with me now? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something?,0
2440,"No, you can take it away now. I just need you to sign here.",0
2441,Here you are.,0
2442,"Just one thing before you go, could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period?",0
2443,"No problem, I'll get on that right away. Thanks, bye.",0
2444,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer. It ' s unbelievable!,1
2445,"Oh, my dear lady. Take it easy. You should forgive a green hand like him.",0
2446,He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy.,1
2447,I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.,0
2448,"I have told him how to do it several times, but he's never listened to me.",1
2449,Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss.,0
2450,"Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.",1
2451,"Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, make sure you don't lose your temper.",0
2452,I think that's a bad idea. I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend. How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?,2
2453,I disagree. All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions.,0
2454,"hey, you look great! how's everything?",0
2455,"yeah, you know what? I've been going to the club regularly. The training really pays off. Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit.",0
2456,really? tell me about it. I haven't gone to the club for a long time. I am too busy with work.,0
2457,it's important to do proper exercises.,0
2458,you're right. Too much or too little won't do any good.,0
2459,"the trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet.",0
2460,sounds reasonable.,0
2461,we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.,0
2462,and fruits!,0
2463,surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.,0
2464,I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?,0
2465,"yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. That can help one to keep sound physical health.",0
2466,"I think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track.",0
2467,you bet it!,0
2468,what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking?,0
2469,"while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking, but I don't really care for the advertisement.",0
2470,why not?,0
2471,the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing!,0
2472,it's a pun. They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking.,0
2473,"I know, but I think it's not really appropriate for young children.",0
2474,I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking.,0
2475,all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty.,0
2476,"perhaps you're right,, though. Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow.",0
2477,"I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults, but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them.",0
2478,that's a good point. I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad.,0
2479,"you have to give them credit, though. It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking.",0
2480,"Hi, do you have any tickets for the show tonight?",0
2481,"Sorry, it’ s all sold out.",5
2482,"Well, do you have any for tomorrow?",0
2483,We have tickets for the matinee. It starts at 3p. m.,0
2484,Ok. I’ ll take it.,0
2485,Where would you like to sit?,0
2486,"Do you have anything in the middle section? I want a good view, but sitting too close hurts my eyes.",0
2487,Certainly.,4
2488,Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party?,0
2489,"I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or entertainment?",0
2490,I would like to help you with both.,0
2491,"That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy?",0
2492,A dressy party would be fun!,0
2493,That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best?,0
2494,We should probably have both.,0
2495,"Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?",0
2496,Maybe we could do both!,0
2497,Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details.,4
2498,"Peter, how often do you exercise?",0
2499,"Well, I swim and run every day.",0
2500,"Now, tell me, what do you eat?",0
2501,"Well, I don't eat any meat, but I do eat fish and eggs.",0
2502,Do you eat a lot of vegetables?,0
2503,"Oh yes, and fruit, I love fruit.",0
2504,What do you drink?,0
2505,"Well, I never drink alcohol, coffee or tea. They are very bad for you.",0
2506,What do you drink?,0
2507,How did your company's fundraiser go?,0
2508,"The fundraiser events went really well. We were able to partner with a few of our competitors, all in fun of course, to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society. All of the people who participated it had a great time, and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research.",0
2509,So how does it work? How were you able to make money with the marathon?,0
2510,"Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee. Also, they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran. All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars.",0
2511,Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society.,0
2512,"In all honesty, it's also a great deal for our company. The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community. We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign, plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause.",0
2513,How may I help you today?,0
2514,I need to open a second account.,0
2515,What kind of account would you like to open?,0
2516,I need another savings account.,0
2517,Do you have another account with us?,0
2518,I sure do.,0
2519,Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one?,0
2520,That’ s fine.,0
2521,How much would you like to transfer?,0
2522,Transfer $ 100.,0
2523,Give me a moment while I complete your transaction.,0
2524,That’ s fine. Thank you.,0
2525,How about your grades of study?,0
2526,I have been doing quite well. As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 %. And I’ Ve received Scholarship two times.,0
2527,"Besides your major, do you know some in other fields?",0
2528,"Yes. To develop my knowledge, I studied Economics, Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study. Nowadays, I have passed three courses on CPA.",0
2529,Have you ever been a student cadre?,0
2530,Yes. I used to be the monitor of my class.,0
2531,Did it affect you much?,0
2532,"It’ s a very important experience for me. First, it improved my organizing ability, and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective. Second, it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike.",0
2533,"In your spare time, do you have any part time jobs?",0
2534,"Yes, I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office.",0
2535,What kind of a car do you have?,0
2536,An old one.,0
2537,"I know it's old, but what make is it?",0
2538,It's a Chevrolet. Why do you ask? You going into the car business?,6
2539,"Nothing like that. My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him, so he's going to sell it - cheap. It's practically new.",0
2540,well I have been thinking about getting a newer car. I can't afford a brand new one.,0
2541,Would you like to look at my cousin's car?,0
2542,Is it a four-door or a two-door?,0
2543,It's a coupe with a vinyl roof.,0
2544,Does it have automatic transmission?.,0
2545,"Yes, and it also has power steering, power brakes, and air conditioning.",0
2546,I guess I might take a look at it.,0
2547,Good afternoon. May I help you?,0
2548,"Yes, I’ m here to see Joanna Stevens. I have an appointment at four.",0
2549,"Certainly, may I take your name? I’ ll let her know you’ Ve arrived.",0
2550,"Sure, it’ s Josh O’ Neil.",0
2551,Ms. Stevens will be with you momentarily. Can I offer you something to drink?,0
2552,"Yes, a coffee would be nice, thank you.",0
2553,"Here you are. Ms. Stevens is ready for you now. I’ ll show you to her office, right this way.",0
2554,How about your interview?,0
2555,They turned me down.,5
2556,Why? You are so excellent.,6
2557,I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to.,5
2558,What a shame! You should have showed yourself to them!,5
2559,It doesn't matter. I'll try other companies.,0
2560,I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet.,0
2561,On the Internet? I've never heard of it.,0
2562,It's very convenient and it has become popular recently.,0
2563,Is that safe?,0
2564,"Of course, if you log on some standard websites.",0
2565,Thank you for your advice. I'll have a try.,0
2566,We are here.,0
2567,OK. How much is the fare?,0
2568,The total is 45 yuan.,0

2571,Is there something wrong with your meter?,0
2572,No. I am sure about that.,0
2573,OK. Could you give me a receipt?,0
2574,Yes. This is your receipt.,0
2575,"Ahem... uh, sir, I beg your pardon... Uh, mister, are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie?",0
2576,"What's it look like, lady? This is the ticket line I'm standing in, isn't it?",0
2577,"Well, yes, it is, but...",0
2578,"So, what's your beef anyway, lady?",0
2579,"You just cut into line, in front of me and everyone else, that's what! Go take your place back at the end of the line, like every - one else!",1
2580,"Oh sure, lady, and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out. I'm staying right here, understand? So be a nice lady and butt out!",1
2581,Just what gives you the right...?,1
2582,"Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line. It's as simple as that, lady.",1
2583,"Well, you're no gentleman, either.",0
2584,"Okay, lady, just to show what a gentleman I really am, I'll let you go in front of me. Now, just buy your ticket and shut your trap, will you, lady?",0
2585,Whew! I got the last one. This must be my lucky day!,1
2586,"What was that you just said? Last one...? Hey, they've closed the ticket window!",0

2589,"Gentleman! Hah! Fat chance! Hah! Eat your heart out, sucker! Hah!",1

2619,I don't mind that.,0

2652,Which tests do you mean?,0
2653,You know. Tests like ” how jealous are you? ” and “ are you a fashion victim? ”,0
2654,"Oh, I see. I like to do those tests, too, but I don’ t take them seriously.",0
2655,"Of course not, but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do. According to the jealousy test, I’ m quite a jealous type of person. Perhaps I need to control my jealousy.",0

2738,"Well, I've always wanted to have lots of children. Growing up with only one brother, I always felt a bit lonely. What do you think about families with only one child?",0
2739,"For me, growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention. I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share.",0
2740,Don't you think you would miss having other people around?,0
2741,"No way! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7. You know, I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home. What do you think fo the one-child policy",0
2742,"If China didn't have such a policy, can you imagine how many people there would be in China now?",0
2743,"That's true. But as a woman, I'm glad that even though I don't want any children, I at least have a choice in how many children I have. On the other hand, I can't imagine what China would be like",0
2744,Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child?,0
2745,"I don't know what other people think, but I, for one, envy only children!",0
2746,"Ok, let’ s go through this one more time. I don’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses!",0
2747,"I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.",0
2748,"Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.",0
2749,"So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?",0
2750,"Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.",0
2751,Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it’ s all set right?,4
2752,"No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.",0
2753,You know what? I’ ll just have everything dry cleaned.,0
2754,Good afternoon. I'll show you to your room.,0
2755,Thank you.,0
2756,Could you tell me which bags are yours?,0
2757,They're over there next to the door. Those three with green tags on them.,0
2758,"Could you wait a moment? I have to get a trolley. May I see your room key, please?",0
2759,"Sure, here it is.",0
2760,"Thank you. Room 402. You're on the 4th floor. This way, please.",0
2761,"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the railway station?",0
2762,The railway station? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner. The station is at the end of that street.,0
2763,How long will it take me to get there?,0
2764,It's about a ten-minute walk.,0
2765,That's very clear. I think I can find my way now. Thank you.,4
2766,Not at all.,4
2767,I have here our price sheet on a F. O. B. basis. The prices are given without engagement.,0
2768,"Good, if you’ ll excuse me, I’ ll go over the sheet right now.",0
2769,Take your time.,0
2770,I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high.,0
2771,I’ m surprised to hear you say so. You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years.,0
2772,"We only ask that your prices be comparable to others. That’ s reasonable, isn’ t it?",0
2773,"Well, to get the business done, we can consider making some concessions in our price. But first, you’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us, so that we may adjust our prices accordingly.",0
2774,The size of our order depends greatly on the prices. Let’ s settle that matter first.,0
2775,"Well, as I’ Ve said, if your order is large enough, we’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent.",0
2776,"When I say your prices are much too high, I don’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent.",0
2777,How much do you mean then? Can you give me a rough idea?,0
2778,"To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help.",0
2779,Impossible. How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent?,0
2780,I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers. It’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet. May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say?,0
2781,"Very well, I will.",0
2782,"Excuse me, you look lost.Can I help you?",0
2783,"Oh, Thank you. I'm looking for the train station.",4
2784,Right. Let me see. You go straight down here and turn right.,0
2785,"Right? OK, got it.",0
2786,Then take the next left then the next right. Are you with me?,0
2787,Next left then right? OK.,0
2788,"I'm sorry, but I didn't catch what you said.",0
2789,"I said, ' Do you want me to help you? '",0
2790,I'm trying to find a post office.,0
2791,Go three blocks and turn right. It's right there.,0
2792,Should I take the bus?,0
2793,No. It'll only take about five minutes to walk.,0
2794,Thank you very much.,4
2795,Anytime.,4
2796,It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature.,0
2797,Right. Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background.,0
2798,Yes.,0
2799,But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people. So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate.,0
2800,So you must be an extravert?,0
2801,"Yes, I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them.",0
2802,What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide?,0
2803,"A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities, and offering service of transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, shopping and entertainment.",0
2804,Don't you consider it a hard work?,0
2805,"Hard but interesting, I think.",0
2806,Have you any experience as a tourist guide?,0
2807,"Yes, I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University.",0
2808,Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English?,0
2809,"Yes, I have learned a little French and Japanese as well.",0
2810,"Didn’ t you punch in this morning, Monica?",0
2811,"Sorry, I don’ t know the rule about punching.",0
2812,That’ s ok. I should have told you earlier. This is a company rule.,0
2813,Do we also need to punch out after work?,0
2814,"According to the company rule, we should punch in before 8 o’ clock and punch out after 5 o’ clock every work day.",0
2815,"How about the lunch break, Lucy?",0
2816,From 11 thirty to 1 o’ clock.,0
2817,May I ask whether we need to work overtime?,0
2818,"Sometimes, but not quite often.",0
2819,What's the problem?,0
2820,I have a laceration on my left forearm.,0
2821,Let me have a look. How did this happen?,0
2822,I got hit by a car in an accident.,0
2823,Was there much bleeding afterward?,0
2824,"No, not much.",0
2825,"Well, this doesn't look too serious. Nurse, could you please get me a suture set?",0
2826,Will I need stitches?,0
2827,"Yes. Three, I think. It wont ' be too painful. Alright, we're done. That wasn't so bad, was it?",0
2828,"No, not really.",0
2829,You're lucky there was no lasting damage. I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days. We'll take those stitches out then. So long.,0
2830,"Thank you, doctor. Bye.",4
2831,What time is it?,0
2832,Ten to nine.,0
2833,Your watch is ten minutes slow. So it's should be nine sharp. I'm gonna be late again. What will be my excuse this time? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty.,0
2834,"Don't cry over spilled milk, Fred? Could you stay with me a few minutes?",0
2835,What? Why? What's wrong with you?,0
2836,I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring. My sickness makes it worse. When will I recover?,5
2837,"You will be fine in the couple of month, just be patient. I've got to woke now, I'll be late.",0
2838,You only care about your work.,5
2839,"Sorry, baby, you are everything to me. all I do just for our family.",0
2840,"Stay just a few minutes longer, OK?",0
2841,"OK, I'll leave at 9:15, Is that all right?",0
2842,Yes.,4
2843,"I'll spent more time with you in the future, Dina.",0
2844,Thank you.,4
2845,Canton Hotel.,0
2846,"I'd like to reserve a double room. I will be arriving next Monday, the 12th. My name is Wilson.",0
2847,A double room for the 12th? The name is Wilson?,0
2848,"Yes, that's right.",0
2849,How long will you be staying?,0
2850,"Three or four days, perhaps longer.",0
2851,"Very good, sir. We will be expecting you next Monday, the 12th.",0
2852,How is the result of your lab test?,0
2853,"When it comes to that, I have a lot to say.",0
2854,Then say it.,0
2855,"When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests, I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death. Then you guess what he said.",0
2856,That’ s just what I want to know.,0
2857,He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me.,4
2858,Could you tell me something about your family?,0
2859,"OK. There are five people in my family, Father, mother, elder brother, younger sister and I.",0
2860,Are your brother and sister still in school?,0
2861,My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college.,0
2862,What does your father do?,0
2863,My father is a middle school teacher.,0
2864,What about your mother?,0
2865,My mother is a housewife.,0
2866,Are you married?,0
2867,I am not married yet and I live alone now.,0
2868,Do you need to support your family?,0
2869,"No, my father and brother are doing that.",0
2870,Have you finished school?,0
2871,"Yes, I have already graduated.",0
2872,I'm in heaven! A Whirlpool dryer!,4
2873,"I love them, too. Let's move into the kitchen. Wait until you see the refrigerator.",4
2874,This is too good to be true.,4
2875,"And the stove is brand new. You know how to use a gas stove, right?",4
2876,"Yes. We've lived in Taiwan for a while. I had a gas stove in the States, too.",4
2877,"It's better for cooking Chinese food. Well, what do you think?",4
2878,We love it. But we'd like to know about the neighbors.,4
2879,How's your new car?,0
2880,Perfect! Couldn't be better.,0
2881,"You made a good choice, then?",0
2882,It's just what I want.,0
2883,No regrets?,0
2884,I am really pleased with it.,4
2885,I am glad you are happy.,4
2886,It's super.,4
2887,"Good afternoon, Sir. You're here to see about a Temporary Loan, right? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets. Is that what you require?",0
2888,"Yes, that's exactly what I need. How about terms for these?",0
2889,"Well, we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans. The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period.",0
2890,Is there any flexibility on that?,0
2891,"Unfortunately, not.",0
2892,"OK. In my position, I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan. That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan.",0
2893,"Not a problem, Sir. If you'd just fill out these forms, and of course with necessary clearance, we can get you the money right away.",0
2894,"Mr. Wang, I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai. You can make some changes if it does not suit you.",0
2895,All right. Please read it to me.,0
2896,"On Friday morning, Mr. Wang, the director of Shanghai Research Institute, will visit you at the hotel. In the afternoon, you will discuss some problems with Mr. Yang, vice manager of computer corporation.",0
2897,Very good.,0
2898,"On Saturday, you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing. Miss Lu will be your guide.",0
2899,"Oh, that's great.",4
2900,"Hi, I would like to return this TV.",0
2901,"Sure, do you have the receipt?",0
2902,Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard.,0
2903,Ok. may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?,0
2904,The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.,0
2905,"I see, and what about the keyboard?",0
2906,I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.,0
2907,"I am sorry mam, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.",5
2908,Fine! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.,1
2909,There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out!,0
2910,Luckily we got the last two.,0
2911,"Look, Danny. The Four Great Inventions!",6
2912,"Gunpowder, compass, the paper making, and the printing.",0
2913,I really admire those who made such great inventions!,0
2914,"May, I don't see why they are great. They are just simple things.",0
2915,They look simple today. But they were milestones in their times.,0
2916,"Milestones? May, you must be kidding.",6
2917,"Just think Bill Gates, those inventions are as important as the windows system.",0
2918,"Well, I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them.",0
2919,"No, quite the contrary.",0
2920,Why? Didn't you say that they were milestones?,0
2921,"Yes, but they went to the public without any patent protection.",0
2922,"Well, their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates.",0
2923,What can I do for you?,0
2924,I need some medicine.,0
2925,For whom?,0
2926,My wife. She suffers from a bad cold.,0
2927,What symptoms does she have?,0
2928,Fever and a bad cough.,0
2929,"I see. Don't worry, just a common cold.",0
2930,What kind of medicine does she need?,0
2931,Patulin will be enough.,0
2932,How many pills for each time?,0
2933,"Nine pills per day, and three pills after each meal.",0
2934,Thank you very much.,0
2935,It's my pleasure.,0
2936,Do you believe in god?,0
2937,Not at all. I’ m an agnostic. do you?,0
2938,I’ m not sure. Why don’ t you believe there is a god?,0
2939,I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.,0
2940,"I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, there are many things that science hasn’ t explained yet.",0
2941,I’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.,0
2942,For example?,0
2943,"Religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.",0
2944,Yes. Such people don’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.,0
2945,Excuse me.,0
2946,"Hello sir, may I help you?",0
2947,Yes. Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please?,0
2948,Sure. Here it is.,0
2949,How much does it cost?,0
2950,50 dollars.,0
2951,50 dollars. That's too much.,6
2952,How about this one? It's on sale for only 35 dollars.,0
2953,I don't like that one.,0
2954,How about the one next to the black gloves? It's very similar to the one you like.,0
2955,That's nice. How much is it?,0
2956,30 dollars.,0
2957,That'll be fine.,0
2958,"Is this color OK, or would you like a different color?",0
2959,That blue one's fine.,0
2960,Do you need any more of these shirts?,0
2961,Yes.,0
2962,How many do you want?,0
2963,"I'll take two more, a red one and a white one.",0
2964,"Hello, this is Li Bo speaking.",0
2965,"Hi, I am Liu Ming. I am calling to tell you that I have got the job.",0
2966,"Oh, that is wonderful. Congratulations!",4
2967,I really feel grateful to you for your reference. They have mentioned this in the job interview.,4
2968,Don't mention it. I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality.,4
2969,Thanks again. I will start on next Monday. I am sure I will have good performance.,4
2970,I agree.,0
2971,"I am a student in Cambridge University. I read your ad, I want to know something more about your room, please?",0
2972,"It's a big bedroom with a drawing room, facing a beautiful wood.",0
2973,Is there a bathroom?,0
2974,"No, but there is one downstairs, which my daughter used some years ago.",0
2975,It sounds good. Could I go and see it myself?,4
2976,"Certainly, you're welcome anytime.",0
2977,See you later!,0
2978,"( after a while ) Good afternoon, Mrs. Smith. I called you just now.",0
2979,"Welcome! Come in, please!",4
2980,Yes.,0
2981,This way please. Your room is upstairs... Here it is.,0
2982,"Wonderful! A modest, comfortable room. Ah, a beautiful window, through which I can see a beautiful scene, and hear the birds singing. How nice!",4
2983,"Yes, if you want to wash something, there is a separate lavatory room outside.",0
2984,Excellent! I like it! When can I move in?,4
2985,Anytime you like.,0
2986,OK.,4
2987,"Hello, this is Dunlin. May I speak to Mrs Smith?",0
2988,This is Mrs Smith. Can I help you?,0
2989,I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday.,4
2990,You are welcome. I am very impressed by your capability.,4
2991,Is there anything I should do?,0
2992,"No, nothing. It's thoughtful of you to call me again.",0
2993,Thank you. Please call me at any time if you have any questions.,0
2994,"Ok, I will. Do you have any question?",0
2995,"No, thank you. Goodbye.",0
2996,Goodbye.,0
2997,"There are many art craft items in this shop. I suggest you take your time, and you might find something you like.",0
2998,That's what I am going to do.,0
2999,"If you have any problem, please come to me.",0
3000,I surely will. How much is this wood carving?,0
3001,You are an expert on it. That wood carving is very rare. But I'm so sorry. that is not for sell.,0
3002,That's OK. Is anything else recommended?,0
3003,Do you have any special request?,0
3004,I'd like to see some traditional arts.,0
3005,So that means you are shopping for presents?,0
3006,"Yes, I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends.",0
3007,"Actually, I think the paper-cuts is OK, because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it. They think that is a miracle.",0
3008,Sounds good. I'll take paper-cut.,4
3009,"I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country, you can pick the one you like best.",0
3010,You collect them yourself? I think that you are just doing the wholesale.,0
3011,"As a matter of fact, I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts. I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country.",0
3012,"Wow, you are the expert on it.",4
3013,Operator. Can I help you?,0
3014,"I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing, China. The number is 2135367 8, and I want to speak to Mr. Zhang.",0
3015,To Mr. Zhang in at 2135-3678?,0
3016,"Yes, that's right.",0
3017,May I have your name and telephone number?,0
3018,"My name is Luo Gang, and the phone number is 513-3284.",0
3019,"Mr. Luo, will you hold the line, please - - - Mr. Luo, there is no Zhang at that number. Will you check the number again, please?",0
3020,"What the number I gave you, operator?",0
3021,It's 2135-3678.,0
3022,"Oh, I'm sorry. should have been 2135-3668, not 3678. I've given you a wrong number.",5
3023,Are you sure this time?,0
3024,Yes.,0
3025,OK. Let me try again.,0
3026,Thank you.,4
3027,Are there any special requirements on the project? And shall we talk around it in details?,0
3028,"Yes, there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it. Besides, you see, in recent years, we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness.",0
3029,That's a good idea. We can improve our technology to meet your special need.,0
3030,And please let white color dominate.,0
3031,OK! I've noted it down. And any others?,0
3032,Oh! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city.,0
3033,I'll tell them.,0
3034,"Well, the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor.",0
3035,Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise. And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery.,0
3036,Thanks a lot. And I believe I'll have a good time working with you.,4
3037,I think so. Bye!,4
3038,Bye!,4
3039,"Mr. Black, I ' d like to take some time off. I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days.",0
3040,"That's no problem. Let me see... You still have ten days annual leave left, is that right?",0
3041,Yes. I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off.,0
3042,That's long leave. How's your project coming along?,0
3043,The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week. I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on.,0
3044,"Well, all right. But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave.",0
3045,"Thank you, Mr.Black. There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment. Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence. He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients.",0
3046,Great! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed.,0
3047,"I will. Many thanks, Mr.Black.",0
3048,Did you ever get a parking ticket?,0
3049,Only a few.,0
3050,What's a few?,0
3051,"I've gotten six, I think.",0
3052,Did you pay your fines?,0
3053,Of course I have.,0
3054,How much are the parking tickets?,0
3055,I think they're $ 130.,0
3056,That's expensive.,0
3057,I just got a parking ticket.,0
3058,You should probably pay the fine soon.,0
3059,I'm going to pay it today.,0
3060,"Are you doing anything right now, Diana?",0
3061,"I am typing a report for the moment, Mr. Robbins. Anything I need to do?",0
3062,Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter?,0
3063,Is it urgent?,0
3064,"Yes, this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5. It's about a contract.",0
3065,"Ok, I am coming.",0
3066,"Please take a seat, Diana. Have you got your spare pens and pencils?",0
3067,"Yes, I have this time. But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating, can I ask you halfway?",0
3068,"No, I’ d prefer not. I don't want any interruptions every other minute, but you can ask me at the end of the letter.",0
3069,All right. I understand now. Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments.,0
3070,"Of course, Diana. You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it.",0
3071,"Certainly I will, Mr. Robbins. By the way, may I use a window envelope?",0
3072,"Yes, that's fine. Now when you finish these, I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order, using the last names, and then make a list.",0
3073,You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names?,0
3074,"Right. And the last thing, we are going to clean the files out tomorrow. Now let's begin.",0
3075,You're finally here! What took so long?,4
3076,I got stuck in traffic again. There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection.,0
3077,It's always rather congested down there during rush hour. Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home.,0
3078,"I don't think it can be avoided, to be honest.",0
3079,perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work.,0
3080,I think it's something that I'll have to consider. The public transport system is pretty good.,0
3081,"It would be better for the environment, too.",0
3082,I know. I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city.,0
3083,Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well.,0
3084,The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car.,0
3085,"Well, when it's nicer outside, you can start biking to work. That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides.",0
3086,That's true. I could certainly use the exercise!,4
3087,"So, are you going to quit driving to work then?",0
3088,"Yes, it's not good for me or for the environment.",0
3089,"That's really convenient. We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent, though.",0
3090,I can take two thousand off. That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand.,0
3091,That's great. Every little bit counts. And we don't need the parking space. I guess we could rent it out.,0
3092,"Sure, for at least three thousand per month.",0
3093,That'll bring the price down to twenty-five. That's the price we were shooting for.,0
3094,"I'm glad. Now, there's a deposit fee of two month's rent.",4
3095,Hello. I sent out my laundry yesterday.Aren ' t they ready?,0
3096,They'll be ready by this afternoon.,0
3097,"Oh, no! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning.",6
3098,Is that right? We're very sorry.,5
3099,"I thought it was "" the same day "" service.Anyway, please do hurry.",0
3100,I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock.,5
3101,"Well, then, would you send it to Japan, please?",0
3102,"Yes, we'll do so.",0
3103,"How can I help you, sir?",0
3104,I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue.,0
3105,"Sorry, could you tell me your name?",0
3106,I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova.,0
3107,Do you have an appointment?,0
3108,"Yes, I did it yesterday. Our meeting should be 2 pm.",0

3110,Thank you.,0
3111,She will be back soon.,0
3112,Excuse me. Would you please make a suit with this material?,0
3113,Sure. May I take your measurements?,0
3114,"Please don't make it too tight. This is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath.",0
3115,"I see, sir. Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th, that's in a week's time?",0
3116,"The 10th? I'm sorry, but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th. Could you have the suit ready by the 8th, or at the latest, the 9th?",0
3117,"Well, a business suit usually takes ten days ' time. But in your case, we'll try to have it ready sooner. How about coming for your fitting on the 8th? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th?",0
3118,"That's fine, thank you.",4
3119,the air quality in this city is horrendous! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again!,1
3120,exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment.,0
3121,"on top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city.",1
3122,"as much as I love this city, I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.",0
3123,"I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse",0
3124,what is the greenhouse effect exactly?,0
3125,it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature.,0
3126,"I see, so it's similar to global warming?",0
3127,"they're related to one another, yes.",0
3128,I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.,0
3129,"people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature, but it's not all good news. They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well.",0
3130,people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations.,0
3131,"I think if everyone pitches in, the world will be a better place.",0
3132,Would you like some cookies? I just made them.,0
3133,"Thank you. Yes, I would.",4
3134,"These are chocolate, and those are almond-flavored.",0
3135,I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm... this is delicious.Are they hard to make?,0
3136,"No, they're really quite easy. Wait a minute, I've got the recipe right here.See... these are the ingredients, and then you just follow the directions.",0
3137,That does look easy. I think I'll make some tonight.,4
3138,"How do you use an ATM card, Billy?",0
3139,It’ s easy grandpa. Insert you card into the machine here. Then wait a moment. Ok. Now you enter your PIN. It should have four numbers.,0
3140,Oh yes. I’ Ve got it written down here. Just a minute.,0
3141,You really shouldn’ t write it down. You should memorise it. You can change it to a more convenient number if you like.,0
3142,"Ok, I’ Ve entered my PIN. There are several options on the screen. I guess I just choose which service I want, don’ t I?",0
3143,"Yes. Choose the service you need to use. If you choose to withdraw money, the machine will ask you how much you want.",0
3144,"I can just enter the amount using the key, right?",0
3145,That’ s right. Give the machine a moment to process you request. Then take your money.,0
3146,"These machines aren’ t very difficult to use. In fact, I quite like them. They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk.",4
3147,"Good afternoon, Miss. What can I do for you?",0
3148,Could you tell me my account balance? My account number is...,0
3149,"Just a moment, please. Your name?",0

3164,"Yes, madam, how much would you like to remit?",0
3165,"2,000 AD $.",0
3166,"Which would you like to remit, by mail or by cable?",0
3167,What is the difference between them?,0
3168,"The cable will take less time for your account, in the meantime, the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one.",0
3169,"Well, I think the cable is better.",0
3170,"OK, please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary, your name and telephone.",0
3171,All right. Here you are.,0
3172,Everything is OK. The commission is 50 yuan.,0
3173,Here you are. Thanks a lot.,4

3181,"Yeah, it's very funny. Have you ever watched it before?",0
3182,"No, I haven't. This is my first time to watch it.",0
3183,I'm sure you will like it.,0
3184,"Every honored guests, welcome to Hang Thou. Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring.",0
3185,"How can we relate tiger to this spot, Miss Zhang?",0
3186,"Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole, and then a spring gushed out from it.",0
3187,How ignorant I am!,0
3188,The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake. ”,0
3189,I know that tea. It smells fragrant.,0
3190,"That's right. All my guests, attention please. We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos. And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools.",0

3204,Goodbye.,0
3205,"Hi, Customer Service Desk. What can I do for you today, sir?",0
3206,Good morning. I bought this vacuum here a few months ago. It doesn’ t work now. Can I return it or get it fixed?,0
3207,Do you have your receipt with you?,0
3208,"Yes, I do.",0

3210,Four months ago.,0
3211,"I’ m sorry. You can’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it. In order to receive a refund, you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase.",5
3212,But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty.,0

3266,OK. What?,0
3267,It isn't gratitude. It's fear. Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor.,0
3268,You wouldn't do that. Would you?,0
3269,I might. Vince knows he needs to keep me happy.,0
3270,What about your accounts?,0

3308,How do you like them?,0
3309,Not bad.,0
3310,I always have the temptation to eat something there.,0

3316,That's my greatest concern. But how can you tell which one is clean?,0
3317,I judge by appearances.,0
3318,I got it. I think it's worth trying.,0
3319,It certainly is.,0
3320,"I'd like to try some kebab, roasted squid, and many different appealing things.",0
3321,"Don't try everything at one time, please.",0

3332,"Someone will be up shortly with your order, sir.",0
3333,"I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer, so I need to exchange some US dollars. Can I get the foreign currency at any bank?",0
3334,"I don't think you can. In China, our currency is not freely convertible yet.",0
3335,Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money?,0
3336,"No. You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them. The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000.",0
3337,"Only $ 2,000? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged?",6
3338,The only official way is to go to Bank of China.,0
3339,I'd better take more dollars with me. It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends.,0

3345,"no, just occasionally",0
3346,"oh, i like this music very much, let's tango.",4
3347,i'm afraid i can't dance well.,0
3348,"Well, it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater.",0
3349,Too bad. I did anyway.,0
3350,No wonder you brought such a big bag today.,0
3351,I brought Strawberry Sticks. See?,0
3352,Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating!,6
3353,Yep. And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating.,0
3354,I think that you look very cute today.,4
3355,Is that right? This is a brand new outfit.,4

3376,Walk?,0
3377,Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time.,0
3378,Oh no.,0
3379,"Use the stairs, never the elevator.",0
3380,"Oh, dear.",0
3381,"And three times a week, you can either swim, play racketball, or hand ball.",0
3382,Oh no.,0
3383,"OK, you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class.",0
3384,Dance class! I don't know how.,6
3385,You will.,0

3401,They are all listed here on this sheet of paper.,0
3402,"Is it their home, office or cell phone numbers?",0
3403,"Unless it’ s marked differently, it’ s their home numbers.",0
3404,Alright. What if I can’ t get a hold of them by phone?,0
3405,"Then, you should e-mail them with the information.",0
3406,Where can I find their e-mail addresses?,0
3407,They should have then listed on their resumes.,0
3408,And if there aren’ t any e-mail addresses?,0
3409,Then send them a SMS on their cell phone.,0
3410,Ok. That sounds easy enough. Have you called any of them yet?,0
3411,"Yes. I called the first three people on the list, but they didn’ t pick up.",0
3412,Did you leave a voice message?,0
3413,I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list.,0
3414,I see. What did you tell her?,0
3415,I told her that she should call me back at my office number.,0
3416,"Ok, so, maybe I should call her again.",0
3417,"Yes, that sounds like a good idea. She might not get the other message in time.",0
3418,One more question. It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance. Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them?,0
3419,Sure. You can use this one. The pin number is written on the back of the card.,0
3420,Alright. Thanks a lot. Don’ t worry. I’ ll take care of it.,0

3428,"Yes, our company has two floors, the 6th and 7th floor in this building.",0
3429,It’ s such a large firm. Do we have our own staff restaurant?,0
3430,"Yes, at the end of the hall.",0
3431,We came too early. There're still three hours before the performance starts.,0
3432,"I know. Sorry, I shouldn't have rushed you, but I just couldn't stay at home and wait.",5
3433,Never mind. What about taking a look around the theater?,0
3434,Why not? I'd love to do that.,4
3435,Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art.,0
3436,Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them?,4
3437,Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery?,0
3438,I surely do. They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that.,0

3440,Unbelievable! I could never do that.,6
3441,"The environment varies greatly because of difference in language, customs and traditions.",0
3442,Yes. This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting.,0
3443,But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers.,0
3444,That's right. They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury.,0
3445,"Therefore, when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market, they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount.",0
3446,Exactly!,4
3447,"Hello, I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position.",0

3482,Thanks again.,4
3483,I'm done. Can I watch TV?,0
3484,Here's some water. Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol.,0
3485,"Uh! I can't swallow them, Mom!",1
3486,Your throat must be swollen.,0
3487,Do I have to take them?,0
3488,"Here, I'll break them up, so they're smaller. And here's some cough syrup.",0

3497,What about the loan repayment?,0
3498,"You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank, for example, payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments.",0
3499,Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest?,0
3500,Exactly. You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank.,0
3501,That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you so much.,4
3502,You're welcome.,4
3503,You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment.,0
3504,That apartment never had any problems before. Are you sure the problem isn’ t you?,0
3505,We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix.,0
3506,Where do you think you have problems?,0
3507,"There is no hot water, the bedroom has a broken window, and there are rats in the kitchen.",0
3508,"You know, no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before.",0

3529,"It begins at 6:40 every morning, and it goes for 20 minutes.",0

3536,"Certainly! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet. Dogs are very demanding. You need to take them for walks and they love to play. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent.",0
3537,"I’ m fairly busy, so I really need an animal that I don’ t need to care of very much. Actually, I’ d like a pet that’ s a little unusual. I don't’ really want a typical pet, like a cat, dog, or hamster. Do you have any suggestions?",0

3545,Thanks a lot. What I’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week.,4
3546,That’ s fine. You shouldn’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet.,0

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.",0
3762,"I don’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’ t know if you’ re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’ s just too much instability. I wouldn’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate.",0
3763,"But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway, I’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example.they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.",0

3771,"Good, as long as you understand that.",0
3772,"And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?",0
3773,"Yesterday! But no, we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.",4
3774,That sounds ideal.,4
3775,Smells good! What’ s for breakfast?,4
3776,"Well, since we are getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast!",4
3777,Nice! Brunch!,4
3778,"Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes!",4
3779,Wow! You really went all out! Did you make any coffee?,4
3780,"Yeah, just the way you like it! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.",4
3781,Looks good! I’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.,4
3782,Get the jam and butter while you are in there! Oh! And don’ t forget the syrup!,4
3783,"Linda, would you care for some candies or cookies?",0
3784,"No, don't try to tempt me. I'm becoming chubby, and I have to slim down.",0
3785,You are not really chubby. You are actually thin enough.,0
3786,I don't think so. I know I've put on weight this winter.,0
3787,"So you are watching your weight, aren't you?",0
3788,"Yes, to tell you the truth. I am on a diet.",0
3789,How about your grades of study?,0
3790,"I had been doing quite well. In all subjects, I got excellent scores.",0
3791,"Well. In that case, you must have got good records in English, too.",0
3792,"Yes, I was the top student among my classmates.",0
3793,How about your oral English?,0
3794,Quite well. I took the National English Speaking Contest in CCTV 2008 and I got first place.,0
3795,"Excuse me, I'd like to have these pants I bought here yesterday altered. Here's my receipt.",0
3796,"Certainly, sir. What would you like done to them?",0
3797,"They're a little bit too long, so I'd like about half an inch taken off them.",0
3798,"All right, sir. They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon.",0
3799,Thank you very much.,4
3800,It's our pleasure.,4
3801,"Hi, Doris. I hear you are going to the United States next week.",0
3802,So I am.,0
3803,When did you get your passport?,0
3804,I got it last week.,0

3808,Thank you very much.,4
3809,"Hi, how are you?",0
3810,It's nice to meet you. Thanks for coming.,4
3811,It's my pleasure.,4
3812,I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter.,0
3813,Is she acting up in class?,0
3814,Not at all. She's a joy to have in my class.,4
3815,Is she really?,0
3816,She is absolutely wonderful.,4
3817,So she isn't causing you any problems?,0
3818,No. She is actually very intelligent and well behaved.,4
3819,I'm glad to know that you like her.,4
3820,You have nothing to worry about with her.,4
3821,"Good afternoon, ladies. May I help you?",0
3822,"Can we have two adjoining double rooms, sir?",0
3823,"Have you made a reservation, ladies?",0
3824,I'm afraid not.,0
3825,"One moment, please. I have to check if there are rooms available. I'm sorry, ladies. We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors. Would you mind that?",0
3826,We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night.,0
3827,Then may I suggest a family suite? We have just had a cancellation.,0
3828,What is it like?,0
3829,It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds. We could also add rollaways.,0
3830,That's great! How much is it?,4
3831,Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax.,0
3832,That's fine.,0
3833,"But ladies, the room is not yet ready. There will be a delay of about half an hour. Perhaps you could fill in the registration form first, and then rest in our lobby for a while. We will let you know when the room is ready.",0
3834,"Alright, hanks.",0
3835,"Ladies, hotel policy requires one night's room charge as deposit.",0
3836,Do you take traveler's checks?,0

3845,This is he speaking.,0
3846,"Oh, how do you do, Mr.Zhang? This is Mary speaking, I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing.",0
3847,"Oh, thank you.",0
3848,Mr.Wu had told me that you were coming to Changchun. May I call on you at your hotel tomorrow?,0
3849,"Yes, it's all right. Shall we say two in the afternoon?",0
3850,Great. Then I'll be at your hotel at two.,0
3851,All Right.,0
3852,How could I get there?,0
3853,The hotel is near to People's Square. Its name is Bai Ju Hotel.,0
3854,what's your room number?,0
3855,"It's Room 302 on the third floor. But I'll be waiting for you in the lobby, If you can't find me, please page me.",0
3856,"I'll do that, Mr.Zhang, See you tomorrow.",4
3857,See you!,4
3858,Where do you come from?,0
3859,I come from Greece.,0

3870,Excuse me. Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema?,0
3871,Turn left at the second light. You can't miss it.,0
3872,Will it take me long to get there?,0
3873,No. It's not far at all.,0
3874,Thank you very much.,4
3875,That's all right. Have a good day.,4
3876,"Nice to meet you, sir. I come from New Times Clothes Company. We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous. Would you please quote the price?",0
3877,"Before we discuss the price, may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in?",0
3878,Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets.,0
3879,Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity.,0
3880,"That is to say, 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets.",0
3881,"In that case, our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200, and the other is US $ 300 per set.",0
3882,Do you quote CIF or FOB?,0
3883,We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you. You will find our price is most competitive.,0
3884,What are your terms of payment?,0
3885,Letter of credit at sight.,0
3886,Another question. Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment?,0
3887,Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us.,0
3888,"Well, I got all the point. All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor.",0
3889,"OK! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade. We believe that through our cooperation, large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion.",0
3890,Welcome. Can I help you?,0
3891,Do you have any postcards?,0
3892,"Yes, here are what we have exclusively for our guests.",0
3893,Can I have one each?,0
3894,Sure. Take as much as you want. They are free gifts from this shop.,0
3895,Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery?,0
3896,Please try the shop there. They might have them.,0
3897,"Are their cards free, too?",0
3898,"No, their cards are for sale.",0
3899,So what do you think of my new dress?,0
3900,"I think it’ s great! I really like the color, and it goes really well with your eyes. I’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine’ s for a while now, but I wasn’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment.",4
3901,"Um, ninety-five dollars?",0
3902,"Yes, that’ s the price they were advertising it at. I was hoping it might go on sale soon. Why, how much did you pay for it?",0
3903,I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen’ s Boutique. I didn’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else.,0
3904,"Of course! Everything at Helen’ s is overpriced, and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store! Why didn’ t you shop around?",4
3905,"I don’ t know, I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it. I guess I was too impulsive.",0
3906,"Hello, this is ABC Corporation. May I help you?",0
3907,"Yes, I’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today’ s newspaper. Is this position still open?",0
3908,"Yes, but do you have any experiences as a sales manager?",0
3909,"Yes, I have a lot of previous experiences in sales. I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university.",0
3910,That sounds fine. Please give me your name and phone numbers. I’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you. It will most likely be in a couple of days. Is it all right for you?,0
3911,"Yes, my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870.",0
3912,Thank you.,0
3913,I need to find a new furniture set for my living room.,0
3914,Where are you going to find one?,0
3915,I have no idea.,0
3916,Do you want to know where I bought mine?,0
3917,Where'd you get it from?,0
3918,I got it from IKEA.,0
3919,How much did it cost you?,0
3920,It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set.,0
3921,Is the furniture sturdy?,0
3922,The furniture is built extremely well.,0
3923,I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good.,0
3924,"Well, trust me. The quality is fantastic.",4
3925,"What date would you like to depart, sir?",0
3926,Do you have any seats for September 16th?,0
3927,Let's see... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. But I have seats for the 17th.,0
3928,The 17th will be fine.,0
3929,And what date will you be returning?,0
3930,"Hmm, I guess on the 28th.",0
3931,"Okay, you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing JFK at 6:40 p. m. on September 17th. Your return flight is flight 711, departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a. m. on September 28th.",0
3932,Sounds good. Thanks a lot.,0
3933,"Hilton hotel, may I help you?",0
3934,We would like to book a table for 6 at 7:00 in the evening.,0
3935,"OK, sir. We will arrange one for you.",0
3936,Can we bring drinks by ourselves?,0
3937,"Sorry, sir. It's not allowed in our hotel.",0
3938,All right. Thank you.,4
3939,Hello. This is Dr. Galas Office. Can I help you?,0
3940,Yes. I’ d like to make an appointment with Dr. Galas. Could you arrange it for me?,0
3941,Sure. Let me check his schedule. How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30?,0
3942,I’ m not available tomorrow afternoon. How about tomorrow morning?,0
3943,I’ m sorry. Dr. Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning. How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning?,0
3944,That’ s fine. Thanks.,0
3945,"You’ re welcome. Could I have your name and phone number, please?",0
3946,"Certainly. My name is Janet Smith, and my phone number is 610-555-1234.",0
3947,"Very good, Ms. Smith. I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am.",0
3948,Thank you very much.,0
3949,You’ re welcome.,0
3950,"David, how is your interview?",0
3951,I was nervous at that time. What about you?,0
3952,Just fine. I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully. I found some answering skills are useful. These questions are different from exams.,0
3953,We can have a rest now after this tough interview.,0
3954,Don't be rush. It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company.,0
3955,Sounds like a good idea. And I think this can leave deep impression to HR. How can we write a suitable letter?,0
3956,Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company. And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you.,0
3957,I am getting to know your meaning.,0
3958,"Good morning, I made an appointment with Dr. Smith, but I have to change it.",0
3959,"When you made your appointment, what day did you choose?",0
3960,My appointment was on Wednesday.,0
3961,At what time was that appointment?,0
3962,It was for 4,0
3963,I can see the appointment that you had. What day do you need to change to?,0
3964,I want to change to next Tuesday.,0
3965,What time would you prefer?,0
3966,I would prefer three o’ clock in the afternoon.,0
3967,I will put you down for that time. Thank you for calling to reschedule.,0
3968,Can I help you?,0
3969,"En, I am looking for a porter, do you know where I can find one?",0
3970,There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters.,0
3971,What's the charge?,0
3972,"Well, it depends how many pieces of luggages you have.",0
3973,Thank you.,4
3974,Do you think we should travel by bus or by train?,0
3975,"It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster, but much more expensive.",0
3976,"We could face delays if we travel by bus, thanks to traffic jams.",0
3977,Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around.,0
3978,That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus.,0
3979,Really? I think you see more traveling by train.,6
3980,So which form of transport do you prefer to use?,0
3981,"I prefer going by train, even though it costs more.",0
3982,"Ok, then we'll go by train. I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?",0
3983,"The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets, because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles.",0
3984,We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive.,0
3985,"Hello, this is the International Youth Hotel. How can I help you?",0
3986,"oh, yes. I want to check whether you still have any vacancies. I need three single rooms for next Monday.",0
3987,"ok. There're vacancies. Since the peak season is coming, it's advisable to book soon. Would you like to make a reservation now?",0
3988,"yes, please. Do you take credit cards?",0
3989,"yes, we accept all major credit cards.",0
3990,and how about Internet access?,0
3991,there's free Internet access in the lobby.,0
3992,is it available in the rooms?,0
3993,Unfortunately not.,0
3994,that's OK. Is breakfast included?,0
3995,"yes, breakfast is included and parking is available.",0
3996,fantastic. Thank you very much.,0
3997,you're welcome. And we have 24 hour reception. Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions.,0
3998,"What sort of shopping is nearby, Mr. Taylor?",0
3999,Call me John. This is a great area of the city for shopping. There’ s a grocery store just around the corner.,0
4000,What about things other than food?,0
4001,"Well, the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it, including four major department stores.",0
4002,Are there small shops near here as well?,0
4003,"Yes, on 4th street, near the movie theater there are many specialty shops, including clothing boutiques.",0
4004,"Well, that sounds just wonderful.",4
4005,"Yes, it’ s a really nice neighborhood.",4
4006,"Now darling, I know that we've bought this house together, but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it. I think we should sell it.",0
4007,"Oh, no, Nathan, I... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know.Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more.",0
4008,But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished.,0
4009,But don't you like this place? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.,0
4010,"Well, only you liked it really, darling.",0
4011,"Oh, why didn't you say so then? But I still think we've made a good buy.",0
4012,"Hi, Bob, everything okay?",0
4013,More or less. There's just one thing bothering me.,0
4014,Oh? What's that?,6
4015,"Well, you know I have some students studying for their master's degree. One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy.",0
4016,What gift?,0
4017,"It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor. I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift, so I refused it.",0
4018,You refused the gift? That's terrible.,6
4019,"I know, but I really can't accept such an expensive gift. I explained to him why, but he seemed really upset about it. I think he might have taken it the wrong way.",0
4020,Perhaps. He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade.,0
4021,That's what I am worried about. I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored. But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor. I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page.,0
4022,"I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet.",0
4023,"We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.",0
4024,Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?,0
4025,"You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the same thing.",0
4026,"Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?",0
4027,"The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.",0
4028,"Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?",0
4029,The swim stations are open daily from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m.,0
4030,"Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks.",4
4031,"Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.",0
4032,"Hi. Today, I am the interviewer for your visa application.",0
4033,OK. Here is my application form and all the documents.,0
4034,Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America?,0
4035,Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world.,0
4036,OK. Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family?,0
4037,Myself.,0
4038,Have you finished all you preparation?,0
4039,Yes. Everything is ready.,0
4040,I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you.,0
4041,I have time to speak with you. Where would you like to purchase your house?,0
4042,"I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia, but would be open to other suggestions.",0
4043,How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?,0
4044,We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home.,0
4045,Do you need to be located in a particular school district?,0
4046,"It doesn’ t matter, as we do not have any children.",0
4047,"Is a view important to you, or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot?",0
4048,"In a perfect world, we would like a home with a view of the lake.",0
4049,Thank you for all of the information. I will help you find the perfect house for you.,4
4050,Waiter.,0
4051,Would you like anything else?,0
4052,"No, thanks. Please bring us the bill.",0
4053,All right. And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill?,0
4054,"Separate bills, please.",0
4055,Here is your bill. It comes to 80 yuan. And yours is 60 yuan.,0
4056,Here you are. Thank you,4
4057,I would like to order a waistcoat.,0
4058,Have you chosen the material?,0
4059,"Yes, I want it to made of tweed.",0
4060,Fine. And the charge is $ 100.,0
4061,When will it be available?,0
4062,Next Wednesday.,0
4063,"Hi, I'm George. I'll be your waiter this evening. Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes?",0
4064,I'm ready now. I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn.,0
4065,And would you like an appetizer before your meal? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup.,0
4066,"I'll pass on the soup, but I'd like a garden salad.",0
4067,Can I get you anything to drink?,0
4068,"Yes, I'd like a glass of iced tea.",0
4069,Okay. I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad.,0
4070,Thank you.,4
4071,What is your salary at present?,0
4072,"My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year.",0
4073,What are your salary expectations now?,0
4074,"I like to be paid more than that. Hopefully, 120,000 Yuan per year.",0
4075,That's a little more than we had planned.,0
4076,I think you'll find I'm worth that.,0
4077,"I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year. Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance. Is that satisfactory?",0
4078,"Yes, it is quite reasonable.",0
4079,Excuse me. I've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time.,0
4080,"Yes, sir.Just a minute, please, I'll check with the kitchen.",0
4081,"Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes, I'm afraid.",5
4082,We have an appointment in half an hour.,6
4083,I see.,0
4084,Do you have anything else I can have instead?,0
4085,"Well, yes.How about beef stew? We can serve you at once.",0
4086,"I'll take beef stew, then.",0
4087,Oh!!! I have a horrible toothache.,0
4088,You should go to the dentist.,0
4089,I hate dentists.,3
4090,"Well, suffer then. If you have a toothache, you have to go to the dentist.",0
4091,It always hurts. I hate going.,3
4092,"Stop being such a baby. If it really hurts that much, just let them knock you out.",0
4093,"O. K., O. K., I’ ll go.",0
4094,Good. You feel better after you do.,0
4095,"Sally, you look so corporate! What interview do you have today?",0
4096,Amalgamated Trading Company. It's Swiss. Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous?,0
4097,"Yeah, I guess so. I've never actually heard of this one, but...",0
4098,"Well, it's small, but it's a young, dynamic, rapidly-growing company with a progressive, humanistic philosophy.",0
4099,"You didn't read their brochure or anything, did you?",0
4100,"Four times. I'm totally prepared. Oh, no! I forgot to take off my nail polish! And I have to be there in 15 minutes! That's it. I blew it.",5
4101,"Well, they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish... uh... even blue nail polish. Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great.",0
4102,But the competition is fierce this year... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job.,0
4103,"Not quite the only one. I really wanted that job at the magazine, but I still haven't heard from them.",0
4104,I really want to make something for dinner.,0
4105,What are you going to cook?,0
4106,I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make.,0
4107,A teriyaki bowl sounds nice.,4
4108,I don't know how to make that.,0
4109,All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef.,0
4110,"That sounds fairly simple, but how do I cook it?",4
4111,The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice.,0
4112,What's next?,0
4113,Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it.,0
4114,What's the next thing I need to do?,0
4115,Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy.,0
4116,Good morning!,0
4117,Can I speak to Miss Cooper please?,0
4118,"Would you hold on a second, please? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged.",0
4119,"Engaged. Oh, dear! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call?",6
4120,"I'm sorry, sir. I can't interrupt her. I'm sure she won't be very long.",0
4121,How long do you think she'll be?,0
4122,I really can't say how long she'll be.,0
4123,"Can I leave a message, please?",0
4124,"Yes, certainly.",0
4125,Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her?,0
4126,"Yes, sir. I'll ring her on an inside line if you like.",0
4127,Thank you very much.,0
4128,Good morning. Madam. What can I do for you today?,0
4129,Hello. I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card.,0
4130,What seems to be the problem?,0
4131,"I received my new card this morning, but I'm unable to use it.",0
4132,"Oh? You mean, the ATM machine has eaten it?",0
4133,"No, it's right here, see? The ATM will not accept it!",6
4134,"You said you received your card this morning, am I right?",0
4135,"Yes. I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away. So, what's gone wrong?",0
4136,"Did you receive your PIN number yet, Madam? You see, unless you have your new PIN number, to match your new card, you cannot use it. We usually send that separately, around one day after the card, for security reasons.",0
4137,"Well, that explains it. I've been using my old PIN number! Thanks for explaining everything to me.",4
4138,Can you manage chopsticks?,0
4139,Why not? See.,0
4140,Good mastery. How do you like our Chinese food?,4
4141,"Oh, great! It's delicious. You see, I am already putting on weight. There is one thing I don't like however, MSG.",4
4142,What's wrong with MSG? It helps to bring out the taste of the food.,6
4143,According to some studies it may cause cancer.,0
4144,"Oh, don't let that worry you. If that were true, China wouldn't have such a large population.",0
4145,I just happen to have a question for you guys. Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated.,0
4146,I don't know exactly. It's a tradition. Maybe it's for sanitary reasons.,0
4147,"Hi, Francis, how was your business trip?",0
4148,It was a nightmare.,5
4149,What’ s up?,0
4150,"Actually, the business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year.",0
4151,"Sounds quite fruitful, why do you call it still a nightmare then?",0
4152,"Well, the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge. I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam. When I finally got home, I was totally exhausted. But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout.",5
4153,This is really a sad story. Did they trace back your luggage?,0
4154,I am still waiting for their call.,5
4155,"Take it easy, all sufferings have their reward.",0
4156,I'm calling today about a bill that I never received.,0
4157,Can you tell me which credit card it was for?,0
4158,It was for my Master Card.,0
4159,You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.,0
4160,I haven't got it in the mail yet.,0
4161,The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.,0
4162,What am I supposed to do about my bill then?,0
4163,Maybe you should call your post office.,0
4164,"But if it's their mistake, can I get an extension on my bill payment?",0
4165,"Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.",0
4166,"Okay, thank you very much for your help.",0
4167,Not a problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.,0
4168,"OK, Allen. It's your turn. Are you ready?",0
4169,I really would rather just listen. Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing?,0
4170,Come on! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song!,1
4171,"I know, but... Hey, Stanley's here! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night.",0
4172,"Well, you asked for it. Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him. He loves "" The King. """,0
4173,I'll put the song at the front of the list.,0
4174,Here is the document you asked for this morning.,0
4175,"Oh, you are so efficient. I thought you might give it to me tomorrow. Thanks.",4
4176,"You’ re welcome. You know, these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination. The more I think about it, the more I hate myself for being so disorganized. I decided to change the situation as soon as possible. Otherwise I will be more regretful later.",0
4177,"This is encouraging news, good for you! What is your solution, then?",4
4178,The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities. It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place.,0
4179,Sounds not bad! Better performance isn’ t just about doing a lot more. It is about focusing on the right things to do.,4
4180,What happened to you?,0
4181,I think I caught a cold.,0
4182,Do you have any symptoms?,0
4183,Runny nose and coughing.,0
4184,Do you have a fever?,0
4185,"I have just taken the temperature, I don't think so.",0
4186,It's not serious.,0
4187,Are you sure?,0
4188,Yes.,0
4189,What should I do?,0
4190,"You should drink more hot water, and do some exercise.",0
4191,What kind of place shall we rent?,0
4192,"It should be close to the university. Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.",0
4193,Absolutely. That's the most important thing to take into consideration. I'm not too worried about the size of the flat.,0
4194,"Neither am I. so a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. Do you mind if it's in a noisy area.",0
4195,"I don't mind. I'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.",0
4196,"Good point. Ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.",4
4197,"Yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.",0
4198,How much do you think the rent will be?,0
4199,I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.,0
4200,Smells good! What’ s for breakfast?,4
4201,"Well, since we are getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast!",4
4202,Nice! Brunch!,4
4203,"Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes!",4
4204,Wow! You really went all out! Did you make any coffee?,4
4205,"Yeah, just the way you like it! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.",0
4206,Looks good! I’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.,4
4207,Get the jam and butter while you are in there! Oh! And don’ t forget the syrup!,0
4208,Hello.Hot water overflowed from the bathtub.Will you help me?,0
4209,Would you turn off the tap?,0
4210,I did it.,0
4211,Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door?,0
4212,OK. I will.,0
4213,I'll have our housekeeper come right away.,0
4214,I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep.,0
4215,"When you woke up, the water was coming out of the tub.",0
4216,Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance?,0
4217,Would you like some more coffee?,0
4218,No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.,0
4219,The waitress is bringing the bill right now.,0
4220,"This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?",0
4221,"Yes, this waitress did a great job.",0
4222,"OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $ 36.00.",0
4223,What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?,0
4224,"Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you think about 20 % this time?",0
4225,"Yes, 20 % would be perfect.",0
4226,Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00. The total will be $ 43.20.,0
4227,"Yes, that was one fantastic meal!",4
4228,I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.,4
4229,It’ s time for me to go now.,0
4230,Would you like me to go with you?,0
4231,I’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things.,0
4232,Do you want to type that letter?,0
4233,I’ d rather you typed it.,0
4234,Do you want to tell her?,0
4235,I’ d rather you told her.,0
4236,Would you like to come by and play bridge?,0
4237,"Well, let's see. Why don't we go dancing for a change? We haven't done that for a long time.",0
4238,"Well, to tell the truth, I don't really feel like it tonight. I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired.",0
4239,"Hmm. Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.",0
4240,"Oh, we always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?",0
4241,"Well, do you have any suggestions?",0
4242,Let's see. How do you feel about playing bridge?,0
4243,"It's OK with me, but we don't have any beer and things.",0
4244,"Well, shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.",0
4245,OK.,0
4246,"Hello, Janet. It's me... Oh, fine. Just fine. Say, Janet, I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight... No? Well. would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge?",0
4247,What's our target audience for this campaign?,0
4248,"This go-around we're focusing on new moms, families with median income and one or more children under the age of two.",0
4249,Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for?,0
4250,"Well, there are some similarities that come up. Because both groups are made up of mothers... so as before, we can play up on maternal instincts, hygiene, safety, along those lines. But that being said, there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here.",0
4251,"Right, that makes sense. What's the average age?",0
4252,"Demographics say an average age of 28.7, educational background of university or post-grad, annual household income of 40-50 K a year.",0
4253,"John, I'd like to see you in my office for a minute.",0
4254,"Yes, sir, I'll be there in just a moment.",0
4255,"John, I have been watching you. I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed. You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts. I just want to let you to know, after this month's performance reviews, I'm recommending you for promotion.",0
4256,"Gosh sir, thank you, sir! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department.",4
4257,"Well, it's not going to be in our department. I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer. There's supervisory spot opening up in financial. I'm turning your name in for it.",0
4258,"Management? Wow, I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff.",6
4259,You've earned it.,0
4260,How can I help you today?,0
4261,I am returning something that I bought yesterday.,0
4262,What would you like to return?,0
4263,I'm returning a cellphone.,0
4264,Was there something wrong with it?,0
4265,It's defective.,0
4266,What isn't working on it?,0
4267,It keeps turning off on it's own.,0
4268,"Alright, do you have the receipt?",0
4269,I have it right here.,0
4270,I'm going to take care of this and refund your money.,0
4271,Thanks for your help.,4
4272,"Good morning, sir. Can I help you?",0
4273,Good morning. I'd like to cash this check.,0
4274,"Yes, sir. Can you show you identity?",0
4275,What about the driving license?,0
4276,Don't you have any other identification?,0
4277,I am sorry. I only have my driving license with me.,0
4278,Ok. Would you please sign your name on the back of the check?,0
4279,Thank you. Here you are.,0
4280,How do you want your money?,0
4281,Would you give me some in twenties and tens?,0
4282,All right. Please wait for a moment.,0
4283,"Oh, my God! I've been cheated!",1
4284,What? What did you buy?,0
4285,It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it!,1
4286,What is it? Why did you buy a brick?,0
4287,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",0
4288,And?,0
4289,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks.,0
4290,And it's a brick?,0
4291,Yes.,0
4292,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,0
4293,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new.",0
4294,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic.,0
4295,"Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.",0
4296,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?,0
4297,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
4298,"Aha! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So, what I think is, you deserve to get cheated!",0
4299,"C'mon, don't blame me! I thought it was a new camera. We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera. I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box.",0
4300,That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap. That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store. They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick. That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks.,0
4301,"You're right, Sarah. I was a fool. I can't believe it. How could I fall for such a trick?",0
4302,"Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem?",0
4303,"Hey doc. Well, I think I might need glasses. I’ m getting headaches, and I really struggle to see things that are far away. But I have always had 20/20 vision.",0
4304,"Sounds like you may be far-sighted. OK, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.",0
4305,"Mmm... X, E, R, 3, a question mark, and I can’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it’ s the peace sign.",0
4306,"Wow, Arthur! You’ re as blind as a bat!",6
4307,"Yeah, I know, my vision is really blurry at times.",5
4308,"Ok then, head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.",0
4309,Thanks doc!,0
4310,"Arthur, that’ s the bathroom.",0
4311,Would you like some more coffee?,0
4312,No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.,0
4313,Good luck finding the waitress!,0
4314,The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?,0
4315,"I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.",0
4316,Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.,0
4317,So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner.,0
4318,How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?,0
4319,I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.,0
4320,"I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.",0
4321,I think that we should leave 10 %.,0
4322,$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.,0
4323,"A guy in my office got the flu the other day. Today I seem to have come down with it, too.",5
4324,"Very likely. You have a slight fever. Do you have a headache, too?",0
4325,"Yes. I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon, because I'll be on a business trip in two days.",0
4326,"Well, you have to let your flu run its course. You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest. Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery.",0
4327,But I'm going on a business trip in two days!,6
4328,"Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it. If you go out while you are sick, it won't help you recover. You may even pass your disease on to others.",0
4329,Let's go practice your driving.,0
4330,"If that's what you want to do, then we can.",0
4331,Did you buckle your seatbelt?,0
4332,I'm buckled up. What's next?,0
4333,You need to start the car now.,0
4334,What do you want me to do?,0
4335,Go left.,0
4336,How far should I go?,0
4337,I'll let you know when I want you to stop.,0
4338,Tell me before you want me to stop.,0
4339,"All right, try parking here.",0
4340,Thanks. Let's go driving again tomorrow.,4
4341,How may I help you?,0
4342,I’ m making a deposit today.,0
4343,Cash or check?,0
4344,I would like to deposit a check.,0
4345,You need to sign the back.,0
4346,Okay. Here you go.,0
4347,Would you like cash back?,0
4348,"Yes, I would.",0
4349,How much?,0
4350,Let me get $ 150 back.,0
4351,Here you go.,0
4352,Thank you. Have a good one.,4
4353,I'd like to extend my visa for another two years.,0
4354,Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa?,0
4355,Student visa.,0
4356,What is the reason for extension?,0
4357,I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month.,0
4358,We’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you.,0
4359,Do you like the apartment?,0
4360,I absolutely love the apartment.,4
4361,Everything is okay?,0
4362,I do have one problem with the apartment.,0
4363,What’ s the problem?,0
4364,I don’ t like all those stains in the carpet.,0
4365,We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment.,0
4366,I did not know that.,0
4367,"I assure you that we will, and if there are any more problems, feel free to tell me.",0
4368,That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment.,0
4369,I’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice.,4
4370,It’ s absolutely incredible. I’ ll take it.,4
4371,"Come in, Arnold. Have a seat.",0
4372,Good morning.,0
4373,Would you like something to drink?,0
4374,"No, thank you. I just had two cups of coffee at my desk.",0
4375,"So, you're a serious coffee drinker.",0
4376,"Yes, it keeps me going. Sometimes I think I'm addicted.",0
4377,"Well, coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me, it's cigars. Are you a cigar smoker?",0
4378,"No, I've tried them. But I'm not really a smoker.",0
4379,"Well, what would you like to talk to me about?",0
4380,I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal.,0
4381,I'm glad when people have new ideas around here. Tell me about it.,0
4382,It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday.,0
4383,Yes.,0
4384,"Well, I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here.",0
4385,What do you suggest?,0
4386,"The way it is now, the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour. But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation.",0
4387,You mean because people have to go across town to get here.,0
4388,Yes. Some people spend half of the morning on the road.,0
4389,"That's true. But our staff meetings are very important, Arnold. I don't know how we can function without them.",0
4390,I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them.,0
4391,I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful. I'm aware of that.,0
4392,"Here's what I propose. I think we should meet once every two weeks, but meet for ninety minutes or more.",0
4393,Well.,0
4394,I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that.,0
4395,You mean you want to run the meetings?,0
4396,"No, not really run them. But I could help organize them. I could discuss meeting topics with you, and then prepare a schedule for each meeting. I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused, and people would prepare better.",0
4397,Hmm. But we would meet every two weeks.,0
4398,"I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer, and better organized.",0
4399,"I am not against the idea, Arnold.It may really be more efficient, as you say. I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month, and see how it works.",0
4400,Excellent. I would be happy to get started on it.,4
4401,"I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this "" new style. """,0
4402,Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary?,0
4403,Sure. How about this one?,0
4404,Is this the latest edition?,0
4405,Yes. We have both the paperback and the hardcover.,0
4406,What's the difference?,0
4407,The hardcover is more expensive.,0
4408,"Oh! I see. I'll have the paperback, please.",4
4409,"Oriental China Airlines. Good morning, may I help you?",0
4410,I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th.,0
4411,"Lady, let me check. Do you want the morning or the afternoon flight?",0
4412,What's the departure time?,0
4413,2:30,0
4414,"Well, the afternoon will be fine.",0
4415,First class or economy?,0
4416,First class will be preferred.,0
4417,"Well, afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai. May I have your name, please?",0
4418,"My name is Janice. Well, I book this ticket for Nova, the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company. Where can I get the flight ticket?",0
4419,You may take it up at the ticket office. That is located on International Street 150.,0
4420,Where are you feeling the pain?,0
4421,I can’ t stand up! My stomach is killing me!,0
4422,Can you put your hand where it hurts the most?,0
4423,It hurts smack in the middle of my gut!,0
4424,Did this just come on suddenly?,0
4425,"I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over.",0
4426,Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently?,0
4427,"No, and I don’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches.",0
4428,We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is.,0
4429,I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this. Thank you.,0
4430,May I help you?,0
4431,"Yes, I would like to exchange some money.",0
4432,what currency would you like to trade in?,0
4433,I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars. Do you accept $ 100 bills?,0
4434,"No problem, we can accept any denomination. How much would you like to exchange today?",0
4435,"Well, that depends on the rate. How much is the RIB trading at today?",0
4436,"It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier, the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon. The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB, we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right?",0
4437,"I guess, here, give me 5,000 RIB worth. I might as well exchange a little extra. Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow!",0
4438,"May I speak to Mr.Huang, please?",0

4802,Totally agree. What is your solution?,0
4803,"Well, there are two causes of job stress. One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition. So if we want to manage job stress, both we and the companies should do something. For me, I am trying to balance work and leisure time. You know, all work and no play make Jack a dull boy.",0

4876,Sure. It's probably the skiing show. Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors.,0
4877,See that. It's so dangerous. My mom would never allow me to do that.,0
4878,"Hey, don't be so pathetic. It's a maximal sports show. What else can they do to attract more visitors? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show.",0
4879,You are right. But what if the avalanche happened?,0
4880,They are all very experienced and great skiers. So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim.,0
4881,"Anyway, the show is breathtaking. By the way, where did they get so much snow in here?",0

5164,Really? What's that?,0
5165,Everything for summer is 20 % off.,0
5166,I like this T-shirt. Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it?,0
5167,Sure. We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt. Look at this section.,4
5168,This one is good.,4
5169,You have good taste. It is very much in style this year.,4
5170,I'll take this one. How much are they?,0
5171,160 yuan.,0
5172,Here you are.,0
5173,What are you having for lunch?,0
5174,"I got a sandwich, some chips, and a soda.",0
5175,Did you bring that from home?,0
5176,I got it from the cafeteria.,0
5177,What kind of sandwich did you get?,0
5178,They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich.,0
5179,How was it?,0
5180,"Considering it wasn't what I ordered, it was still pretty good.",0
5181,I think I got a sandwich there once before.,0
5182,Really?,6
5183,"Yes, and they didn't get my order right either.",0
5184,Could you project what you would like to be doing five years from now?,0
5185,"As I have some administrative experience from my last job, I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future.",0
5186,How do you plan to accomplish this?,0
5187,By doing everything necessary and for further study.,0
5188,How long would you like to stay with this company?,0
5189,How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other.,0
5190,What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years?,0
5191,I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time.,0
5192,"Hello? This is John Smith.Can I speak to Mr.White, please?",0
5193,This is Mr.White speaking.,0
5194,"Hi. I understand that you have a house for sale, haven’ t you?",0
5195,Yes.,0
5196,I’ d like to know more about it.,0
5197,Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o’ clock?,0
5198,OK. I will be there.,0
5199,Thank you for calling.Goodbye.,4
5200,Bye.,4
5201,"Hey, Jim, you're 15 minutes late. What's up?",0
5202,I got stuck in a traffic jam.,0
5203,"Hurry up, the show is about to start.",0
5204,It looks like you're very interested in the circus.,0
5205,"Yes, I love to see the animal show.",0
5206,"I have never seen those before, but since you're so excited it should be good.",0
5207,I'm sure you'll love it.,0
5208,"Okay, I will go and get some popcorn first.",0
5209,What's the matter?,0
5210,"Checking out, please.",0
5211,"Can I have your keys, please? Thank you. Here's your statement.",0
5212,Excuse me. What are these charges?,0
5213,"Oh, these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar.",0
5214,"Wait a minute. I made a phone call, but I never made a connection.",0
5215,"I know, sir. Those aren't telephone company charges. Those are hotel charges.",0
5216,Isn't that a bit excessive?,1
5217,"I'm sorry, sir. It's our policy.",0
5218,OK. Here is the money.,0
5219,Thank you. Welcome to our hotel again.,0
5220,"Can I help you, sir?",0
5221,"Yes, I'd like to look at some suits.",0
5222,"Oh, this way please. What size do you wear?",0
5223,Size 41. I want something in dark flannel.,0
5224,How about this one?,0
5225,"It feels all right. But if it were a darker color, I'd like it better. This seems too light for winter. Do you think you could get me one?",0
5226,All right. I'll show you something darker. Do you like this one?,0
5227,It looks good. But can I try it on?,0
5228,Of course. Let me help you.,0
5229,"Thanks. It's comfortable. Well, how much is it, please?",4
5230,$ 280.,0
5231,Ok. I'll take it. Here's the money.,4
5232,Come in and sit down.,0
5233,"Thanks, Mr. Liang.",0
5234,"Among all the assistants, I think you're on top of it. Based on the annual evaluation, the board of directors decided to give you a bonus.",0
5235,Really? I am too happy.,4
5236,"I've been reviewing your work over the past few months. Thanks to your excellent work, we benefit much from your project. And you should get the perfect attendance award too.",0
5237,"Thanks for your trust. Owing to my colleagues ' help, I've successfully completed my task.",4
5238,You are very modest and diligent. The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation. You deserve it.,0
5239,Thank you very much. I will redouble my efforts in the future.,4
5240,Donna! How are you? It's good to hear your voice.,0
5241,"Thank you. Jack, it's always a pleasure doing business with you.",0
5242,So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave?,0
5243,"Great! And, how are things in your neck of the woods?",0
5244,Things are so great here. I almost smiled myself to death last week. One of my coworkers had to give me CPR.,4
5245,"Oh.Jack, I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift.",4
5246,Or a curse.,0
5247,"Nope, it's a gift.Anyway, we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time.",0
5248,"That, my dear, was classic sales technique delivered by a professional.",0
5249,Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit?,0
5250,"Heck no, we doubled the price, but because it's you, I'll let you have'em at 50 off.",0
5251,You silver-tongued devil. Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no?,0
5252,"I could, but where's the fun in that?",0
5253,Hi. I’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected?,0
5254,"So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late, but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case.",0
5255,Do you think it’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite?,0
5256,"I think you should stay in the airport. Even though the delay is expected to be two hours, the flight departure could be announced any minute. Who knows?",0
5257,What seems to be the problem?,0
5258,It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings. It happens all the time. No need to worry.,0
5259,Umm... You know... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline. No need to hold my seat.,0
5260,I need to go to the ATM.,0
5261,"So, why don’ t you?",0
5262,I have no idea how to use the ATM.,0
5263,What do you mean?,0
5264,This will be my first time using an ATM.,0
5265,I can help you with that.,0
5266,Explain to me how to use it.,0
5267,Just put your card into the machine.,0
5268,Now what do I do?,0
5269,Then you need to type in your PIN.,0
5270,Now what?,0
5271,"Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that’ s it.",0
5272,Would you like something to drink?,0
5273,Yes please. Do you have any teas?,0
5274,Of course we have lots of teas?,0
5275,What do you recommend?,0
5276,What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea?,0
5277,What’ s this one?,0
5278,That’ s Oolong tea – it’ s a Cantonese tea.,0
5279,"Ok, I’ ll try that.",0
5280,"May, is this the Hall of Ancient China?",0
5281,"Yes. Look at these historical relics here, amazing!",6
5282,Why are they all in glass boxes?,0
5283,For protection. Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air.,0
5284,So there isn't air in the glass boxes?,0
5285,"No, there isn't. They are all vacuumed.",0
5286,"I wonder how old these things are, thousands of years?",0
5287,"Yeah, they all come from a very ancient time.",0
5288,"Hey, look at the three-leg cup. I've seen it on TV.",0
5289,"The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago. It's priceless!",6
5290,"Yeah, it has no value at all. Who will use this cup today?",0
5291,"Danny, priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it.",0
5292,"Oh, it does?",0
5293,What would you like on your pizzas?,0
5294,We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni.,0
5295,"Would you like anything to drink with that? For $ 1.50, you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke.",0
5296,"No, thanks.",0
5297,All right. That'll be $ 12.50. Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes.,0
5298,Thanks.,4
5299,"Comfort Inn, may I help you?",0
5300,I’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center.,0
5301,You’ re in luck! We’ re just a two-minute drive from there. Would you like to make a reservation?,0
5302,Not just yet. I have one or two questions. How much for a single?,0
5303,"During the peak season, a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night. But we’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night. And we’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in",0
5304,"That’ s a good deal. Since this is a working trip, I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients.",0
5305,"Yes, we have five meeting rooms, of various sizes. We can accommodate large meetings and small, informal gatherings as well. Of course, if you have many small meeting, you might consider checking",0
5306,That sounds great. Do you accept checks?,0
5307,"I’ m sorry, sir, we don’ t. But we do accept all major credit cards.",0
5308,"I am sorry to trouble you, but there's a lot of noise in the next room.",0
5309,"Oh, is there? Which room is it?",0
5310,"It's. I think, neighbours on the right.",0
5311,You mean the room thirteen-thirteen?,0
5312,"I'm not sure, but I think so. I'm very exhausted, but I can't sleep.",0
5313,"All right, ma'am. I'll check and tell them to be quiet.",0
5314,"If next room is still noisy, could you give me a different room, please?",0
5315,Have you ever been to Xi’ an?,0
5316,"Yes, I’ Ve been there several times on business trips. But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city.",0
5317,"I’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won’ t miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place.",0
5318,I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening.,0
5319,Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane?,0
5320,"Well, the airport is quite far from the downtown area, but it is still more convenient than taking the train.",0
5321,"Doctor, what is the best way to stay healthy?",0
5322,Having a good diet is probably the most important thing.,0
5323,It is very confusing to know what to eat.,0
5324,"You need plenty of fruits and vegetables, small amounts of protein, and whole grains.",0
5325,Are there certain things that I should avoid?,0
5326,"You shouldn’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine. Also, watch your intake of fatty food.",0
5327,"After watching my diet, what else should I do?",0
5328,"You need to stop smoking, and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day.",0
5329,Can I have a glass of wine now and then?,0
5330,"As long as you don’ t overdo it, a glass of wine a day should be OK.",0
5331,"Darling, I am back. What are you doing?",0
5332,"I am washing clothes. Are you hungry now? Wait for a moment, I'll cook dinner for you. ( Steven bends his brows )",0
5333,"B, should we get a maid?",0
5334,I can do all the housework. We don't need a maid.,0
5335,"You have worked very hard in the office. If we can get someone to help you, you can have more rest.",0
5336,We really don't need to.,0
5337,"You are a good wife, Julia. But you must take care of yourself.",0
5338,Give me some time to think about it.,0
5339,Have you graduated now?,0
5340,Yes. I graduated this past June.,0
5341,Which university did you graduate from?,0
5342,Guangzhou University.,0
5343,What degree did you receive?,0
5344,I received a bachelor's degree in Economics.,0
5345,What courses did you take in college?,0
5346,"My major courses were Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, International Trade, International Finance, World Economy, Psychology and Business English",0
5347,Why did you choose to study Economics?,0
5348,Because I was quite interested in Economics then.,0
5349,Can you speak other languages except English?,0
5350,I can also speak a little Japanese.,0
5351,I am very satisfied with your answers.,4
5352,Thank you very much.,4
5353,"I am sorry, sir. I have broken the reading lamp in my room.",5
5354,"Well, sir. May I have your room number?",0
5355,503. I would like to pay for it.,0
5356,Please fill out the form first.,0
5357,"OK, can you bring me a new one?",0
5358,Of course.,0
5359,Excuse me. I need to refill this prescription.,0
5360,It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills.,0
5361,"Yes, I need to refill it today.",0
5362,"Alright. I'm sorry, Miss. According to our file, this prescription has already been refilled twice.",0
5363,I was worried about that. I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not.,0
5364,"Well, it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription.",0
5365,"Listen. This is an emergency. I tried to call my doctor, but he is out of town. So I can't see him in time. I need this medicine. It is for skin condition. I've run out.Can you just refill it once more?",0
5366,"I'm sorry, Miss. We can't do it. We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out.",0
5367,But I need it. Please. Refill it for me just this once. I can go to the doctor around ten days from now. Then I'll have another prescription.,0
5368,"Miss, I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law. I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription. Never.",0
5369,But I have a prescription. I just need more of it.,0
5370,"A prescription must be valid. It cannot be an expired prescription. I'm sorry, Miss. It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you.",0
5371,"Oh, it will be so expensive! I have a special medical plan, and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor.",0
5372,"Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry.",0
5373,"This is ridiculous! In Taiwan, it is much easier to get medicine when I need it.",1
5374,Maybe that's true. I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too.,0
5375,There are so many record players here. That is hard to choose.,0
5376,Look at this one. It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers.,0
5377,I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound.,0
5378,"Yes, but we shouldn't get any thing too big. Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture.",0
5379,That's right. Now this one looks alright? It's a detached or do you prefer this one? It's Sony.,0
5380,Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration.,0
5381,Ahhchooo!,0
5382,You've been sneezing a lot lately. Are you sick or something?,0
5383,"No. Every spring time around April, I'm stricken with allergies.",0
5384,I never have seasonal allergies.,0
5385,Consider yourself lucky.,0
5386,What are all the symptoms?,0
5387,"Well, as you just saw, I sneeze a lot. Also, my nose becomes very runny, my throat sometimes itches, and my eyes start to water.",0
5388,That doesn't sound good.,0
5389,"No, it's not. So you don't have any type of allergies?",0
5390,"Well, I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol. It runs in the family.",0
5391,Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol.,0
5392,"I get it pretty bad. My whole face turns red, including my ears. My eyes become bloodshot, and I start to itch all over my body.",0
5393,That's pretty bad.,0
5394,But that doesn't stop me from drinking. Ahahah.,4
5395,Let's have a look at the map first.,0
5396,All right. Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here.,0
5397,Let's buy some tickets.,0
5398,The train is coming. There are a lot of people waiting here. let's stand in a better position to get on the train,0
5399,"Well, it's not as crowded as we expected, is it?",0
5400,"No, but it will be soon. Look, there're two empty seats over there. Let's get them.",0
5401,"I want to keep a pet, but I don't know which one to buy?",0
5402,"Dogs are nice, but they are really energetic, and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day.",0
5403,"Having a dog would probably be too much work for me, then.",0
5404,What about cats? They are more independent.,0
5405,"Actually, I was thinking of something a little more exotic. I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat.",0
5406,How about a lizard? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting?,0
5407,"Yeah, are they easy to look after?",0
5408,"Yeah, they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything.",0
5409,Can I be of any service to you?,0
5410,I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship. We'd like to take some home. What would you recommend?,0
5411,"There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example, there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty, embroidery, batik, jade carving, just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind?",0
5412,"No, not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese. And easy to carry.",0
5413,"I would suggest you buy paper-cuts, embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry.",0
5414,"So, we'd like to see some embroidery.",0
5415,"Hey, Mary. We're back. Have you eaten yet?",0
5416,I had some bread for breakfast.,0
5417,Let's go out for brunch.,0
5418,Brunch?,0
5419,"It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch. On Sundays, many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch. Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also.",0
5420,"Actually, many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings, too. It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch.",0
5421,"Hi, my name is Sovia.What’ s your name?",0
5422,My name is Jeff.,0
5423,What do you do?,0
5424,I’ m a podiatrist. What about you?,0
5425,I’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time?,0
5426,"I like to play piano, go bowling and chat with my friends.And you?",0
5427,"I like to hang out with my friends, play games and go swimming.",0
5428,Would you like to go out some time?,0
5429,"Sure, that’ d be great.Where would you like to go?",4
5430,Anywhere with you.,0
5431,Aren’ t you sweet.,4
5432,"Oh, I'm starving. I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine. What would you recommend, waiter?",0
5433,"Well, it depends. You see, there are eight famous Chinese for instance, the Sichuan cuisine, and the Hunan cuisine.",0
5434,"They are both spicy hot, I've heard.",0
5435,"That's right. If you like hot dishes, you could try some.",0
5436,They might be too hot for me.,0
5437,Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine. Most southerners like them.,0
5438,What about any special Beijing dishes?,0
5439,There's the Beijing roast duck.,0
5440,"Oh, yes. I've heard a lot about it. I'd like very much to try it. Where can I find it?",0
5441,"You can find it in most restaurants, but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant.",0
5442,Is it near here?,0
5443,"Not too near but not too far either. A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes, If the traffic is not too bad, I mean.",0
5444,"Well, thank you for your information. But what is the name of that restaurant again?",0
5445,Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you. You can show it to the taxi-driver.,0
5446,That's very kind of you. Thanks a lot.,4
5447,"hi, Isaiah. How are you?",0
5448,I’ m well. And you?,0
5449,fine. How’ s your job going?,0
5450,"I don’ t know if I told you or not, but I decided to start my own business.",0
5451,really? That’ s fantastic. What kind of business is it?,6
5452,I’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs.,0
5453,how’ s it going?,0
5454,"it started off a bit slow, but now, business is really booming!",4
5455,that’ s such great news. I’ m really happy for you! Where is your office located?,4
5456,"our headoffice is here in Beijing, but we’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon.",0
5457,where will those be located?,0
5458,"if all goes well, we’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October.",0
5459,when will you find out?,0
5460,we’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow.,0
5461,"well, good luck. I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow!",4
5462,thanks!,4
5463,"Ant Shirley, it's being years since we last met. How were you doing in the passing years?",0
5464,Pretty well. What about you?,4
5465,Fine. Where are the other guys?,0
5466,It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie.,0
5467,Bad timing. I want to see them so much. How are they?,0
5468,"Not bad. I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer, right?",0
5469,"Yes, that's why I'm here. I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment.",0
5470,Did you go to a real estate agent?,0
5471,"No, that will be too expensive.",0
5472,"That's true. By the way, what kind of apartment are you looking for?",0
5473,My first job's salary will be a bit low. So the cheaper the better. Just one I can afford.,0
5474,Sure. I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you.,4
5475,I'll appreciate it so much.,4
5476,Good afternoon.,0
5477,My goodness! It’ s the afternoon? Doesn’ t the time fly! Do come in and sit down.,0
5478,Thank you.,4
5479,What’ s the time? My watch has stopped.,0
5480,It’ s half past twelve.,0
5481,When do you have lunch?,0
5482,From one to two.,0
5483,What do you normally eat?,0
5484,We usually go to the cafeteria.,0
5485,"Oh, it’ s time to have lunch now.",0
5486,let’ s go together.,0
5487,"Merry Christmas, Bill.",0
5488,"Merry Christmas, Jina.",0
5489,What are you doing there on the computer?,0
5490,"Come have a look, I received many beautiful e-cards. They are from my friends, all over the world. Christmas wishes for all my friends.",4
5491,That's pretty interesting. Did you get one from Haven? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number.,0
5492,"Sorry, I don't have it. But I do have her Email. You want me to sent it to you?",0
5493,"Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.",4
5494,No worries. I just for her card. And you can get her from Email. I would really like to talk to her again. I kind of miss her a little this days.,0
5495,Thanks million.,4
5496,My pleasure.,4
5497,There are so many eating utensils on the table. Which ones do I use first?,0
5498,Use them from the outside in.,0
5499,I see. A set for appetizers and another for the main course.,0
5500,Right. We do the same thing at home. Don't you remember?,0
5501,Oh yeah. The big napkin goes on my lap.,0
5502,Let's look at our menus.,0
5503,"Cindy, help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking.",0
5504,"Well, we order appetizers first and then entrees.",0
5505,It was nice talking to you.,0
5506,Why are you trying to rush me off the phone?,1
5507,I really have to go.,0
5508,Why? I still wanted to talk to you.,1
5509,I have things to do.,0
5510,Like what?,0
5511,Don't be nosey.,1
5512,I'm not. I just want to know.,0
5513,"Well, it's really none of your business.",0
5514,That's harsh.,1
5515,"I'm sorry, but I have to go.",0
5516,Fine.,0
5517,"Well, Peter, you have to do better than that next time, won’ t you?",0

5519,"Of course, you have. You must try harder this time.",0
5520,And must I go back to school?,0
5521,"No, you needn’ t do that. You’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.",0
5522,"But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I’ m nearly 17.",0
5523,You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn’ t have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study.,0
5524,What else I’ Ve got to do? Join the army?,0
5525,Who knows! That might come to later.,0
5526,How do you do?,0

5529,I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province.,0
5530,"You're from Tangshan? I can't believe my ears. I was also born in Tangshan, but I was brought up in Beijing.",6
5531,Really? It's nice to meet you. How long have you been with this company?,6
5532,"Just over 4 years now. Since this is your first day here, I'm sure you don't really know too much yet. Let me show you around, so you can introduce yourself to everyone.",0
5533,"Oh, Thank you very much!",4
5534,I like to open up a savings account please.,0
5535,O. K. We offer a few different kinds.,0
5536,I want the one with the highest interest rate.,0
5537,That would be our Saver's Plus account.,0
5538,"4.5 %, that's good. How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate?",0
5539,"You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 %.",0
5540,All right. I’ ll open one of those.,0
5541,"Just fill out these forms, and I’ ll be with you in one second.",0
5542,Thanks.,0

5548,You're welcome.,4
5549,Do you develop films here?,0
5550,"Yes, we shall. What size do you like?",0
5551,"Well, the 4 x 6 is fine.",0
5552,"Which do you prefer, color or black and white?",0
5553,"The last one is black and white, all the rest should need color.",0
5554,OK.,0
5555,I hope they will come out well. When should I pick them up?,0
5556,"They will be ready at noon tomorrow. Each negative develops one print, right?",0
5557,"Yes, it is. And develop them as glossy as possible.",0
5558,No problem. Do you need another film?,0
5559,"Yes, a roll of Kodak film please.",0
5560,It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films.,0
5561,I need help. I think my arm is broken.,0
5562,Alright. Have you been to this hospital before?,0
5563,"No, I haven't. I need help quick. It hurts really badly.",0
5564,I understand. It's good you came to the emergency room.,0
5565,Let me see a doctor.,0
5566,"I'm sorry, sir. You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight. There was a big car accident on Highway 106.",0
5567,I thought this was the emergency room.,0
5568,"It is. But unless you are critically injured, you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding, are you?",0
5569,No. Only a little. I fell off my porch.,0
5570,"Oh, that's terrible. Is it your right arm or your left arm?",0
5571,My left arm.,0
5572,Can you fill out this form then?,0
5573,"No, I can't. I'm left-handed.",0
5574,That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm.,0
5575,Yes. But why do I have to fill out a form anyway? This is the emergency room.,0
5576,"Yes, it is. But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before?",0
5577,No. Just let me see a doctor. I'm worried about my arm.,0
5578,"Be brave, sir. It won't be long. I will fill out the form for you. What is your name?",0
5579,Steve Schliessman. S C H L I E S S M A N.,0
5580,Alright Steve. Your social security number?,0
5581,349-95- 8821.,0
5582,Do you have medical insurance?,0
5583,"Yes, I do. Blue Cross.",0
5584,Do you have your insurance card with you?,0
5585,"No, I don't.",0
5586,"Well, you can call it in later. You can phone us.",0
5587,Can I sit down now?,0
5588,First I need to get your address. Try to move your arm as little as possible.,0
5589,Hi! Is that the new laptop you brought last week? It looks very nice.,4
5590,"Yes, it is. Thanks. I’ m just surfing on the internet.",4
5591,Here? In this cafe? How can you do that?,0
5592,"This cafe offers a wireless internet connection. That means I can get on the net for free while I’ m here. Of course, I have to buy a cup of coffee!",0
5593,That’ s great. Can you do it anywhere?,4
5594,No. you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city.,0
5595,"So, what programs do you have on your laptop?",0
5596,I’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs.,0
5597,"I know you are keen on photography. It’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera. Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone, anywhere, at a",0
5598,"It’ s wonderful, isn’ t it? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently?",4
5599,What shall we do today?,0
5600,"We'd better stay in the hotel, because the tour will begin tomorrow.",0
5601,"Let's go out for some exercise, shall we?",0
5602,What an excellent idea!,4
5603,Shall we do some jogging?,0
5604,OK.,0
5605,I feel well now.,4
5606,"Yes, some exercise is necessary for us.",0
5607,Quite right.,0
5608,I was wondering if you need any help on your new project.,0
5609,Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work?,0
5610,I would like to help with the computer work.,0
5611,Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with others?,0
5612,"Yes, I like working like that.",0
5613,We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then?,0
5614,"Yes, I can be there.",0
5615,"Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful.",0
5616,"OK, I will send the information to you.",0
5617,"Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day!",0
5618,"Congratulations, Francis. Your hard working finally pays off. I am so happy for your promotion.",4
5619,"Thanks, Monica. Without support from you and other colleagues, I would not have made it.",4
5620,"I hope I could get promoted some day. Tell me about your experience, ok?",0
5621,"Well, just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough, you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective. Don’ t be afraid of taking challenging. They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal. You learn more from that actually. Sometimes, you need to fail to be successful.",0
5622,How do you think if I volunteer for some work?,0
5623,I think it is a smart idea. Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives.,0
5624,Taxi!,0
5625,"Yes, sir. Where to?",0
5626,"The city square, please.",0
5627,Are you in a hurry?,0
5628,"Yes, I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm. So we're sure we can get there on time?",0
5629,"I'm afraid not, sir. Generally we can, but you know how it is in the rush hour now.",5
5630,I see. Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time.,0
5631,All right. I'll do my best.,0
5632,Oh.we made it. Thank you. How much do I own you?,0
5633,The reading on the kilometer is 12 $.,0
5634,"Here's the money, keep the changes, please.",0
5635,Do you need a receipt?,0
5636,"No, thank you.",4
5637,"Janice, I can't find the document I was working on last month. Can you help me to look for it?",0
5638,"Susan, I'm sorry. Did you look up those files I requested?",0
5639,"Yes, but I still can not find it. Maybe it is in this cabinet.",0
5640,"I couldn't find the files you request, even though I checked all the cross-references. I don't think it's there.",0
5641,I am sure that document was filed.,0
5642,"Well, let me check again under a different heading.",0
5643,Good idea! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files.,0
5644,Maybe that's why I couldn't find it. All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V '.,0
5645,What would you have?,0
5646,I'll try Chinese wine.,0
5647,"What about this dry red? It's good indeed, it never goes to the head.",0
5648,"OK. Give me one, please.",4
5649,Here it is.,4
5650,Thank you.,4
5651,I'm always at your service.,4
5652,Are you planning on voting?,0
5653,Yes. Are you?,0
5654,I will be voting tomorrow.,0
5655,What’ s your polling place?,0
5656,My polling place is at the park up the street.,0
5657,"Oh, yeah?",0
5658,"Yeah, where is yours?",0
5659,I don’ t know.,0
5660,How is it you don’ t know?,6
5661,The location of my polling place never came in the mail.,0
5662,You can always just check online.,0
5663,Let me go do that.,0
5664,"What's wrong, officer?",0
5665,"You do realize that you ran a red light, don't you?",0
5666,I did?,6
5667,You didn't see the red light?,0
5668,"I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know.",5
5669,Didn't you learn that red means stop?,0
5670,I know that.,0
5671,Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light.,0
5672,I'm not sure.,0
5673,I'm giving you a ticket for this.,0
5674,I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.,5
5675,Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.,0
5676,"Medicine Industry, this is Peter Bush speaking, can I help you?",0
5677,"Good afternoon, could you connect this call with Mr Brown, please",0
5678,May I know who's calling?,0
5679,This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited. I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company.,0
5680,"I'm sorry, Mrs Li, Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number, and ask him to call you back later?",0
5681,I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay.,0
5682,"Ok, then would you please hold the line? Mr Li, the line is through, Mr Brown is ready answering the call, go ahead.",0
5683,"Thank you for your assistance, Mr Bush.",0
5684,You are welcome.,0
5685,"Bob, would you come and help me?",0
5686,"Of course. What do you want me to do, Mom?",0
5687,Could you hold these packages while I look for the key?,0
5688,"Alright, what's in them? They are so heavy!",0
5689,Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow.,0
5690,"Well, hurry up and open the door please. I told you these things are heavy.",0
5691,"I'm sorry, but I just can't find the key. You must have it.",5
5692,"Oh, yes, it's in my pocket. But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags?",0
5693,Isn't it past your bedtime already?,0
5694,I am not sleepy.,0
5695,"It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow.",0
5696,There is no way that I can fall asleep right now.,0
5697,Try listening to some soft music.,0
5698,It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired.,0
5699,"I really don't care, just go to sleep.",0
5700,"What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?",0
5701,You'll be up all night if I let you do that.,0
5702,I'm going to get to sleep eventually.,0
5703,"You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.",0
5704,Good night.,0
5705,I want to go try on these clothes.,0
5706,What did you find?,0
5707,"I found some jeans, and a new blouse.",0
5708,Go and try it on.,0
5709,What do you think?,0
5710,I love that shirt on you.,0
5711,What about the jeans?,0
5712,They don't really fit you right.,0
5713,I don't think so either.,0
5714,That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though.,0
5715,"Well, I'll just buy the shirt.",0
5716,That would be a good idea.,4
5717,"Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I’ m quite impressed.",0
5718,Thank you very much. I’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear. If there’ s any questions please feel free to ask me.,0
5719,"Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.",0
5720,"Yes, of course. Well as you can see from the resume I’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around sixteen.",0
5721,"Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?",0
5722,"Yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.",0
5723,Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.,0
5724,Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I’ m really looking to settle down.,0
5725,"I see. okay, well let’ s move on to discuss your education shall we?",0
5726,"Can you tell me, Ms. Smith, about the training programs you initiated this year?",0
5727,We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained.,0
5728,What’ s the result?,0
5729,We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received.,0
5730,That seems very impressive. Good work!,4
5731,"Thank you, but I cannot take all the credit. Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level.",4
5732,"Well, good morning, Tom. I haven't seen you for a long time.",0
5733,I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago.,5
5734,What seems to be the trouble now?,0
5735,"I feel run down, tired. I've been having headaches almost every day. And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do.",0
5736,"Have you been eating properly? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health, you know.",0
5737,"Well, I haven't been eating well, I guess. I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch.",5
5738,And what about dinner?,0
5739,Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all.,0
5740,That's not good. You don't have a well-balanced diet. Have you been taking vitamin pills?,0
5741,I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first.,0
5742,Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us.,4
5743,"No, thank you.",4
5744,"Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you, sir?",0
5745,That would be great.,4
5746,When do you want it delivered?,0
5747,I need it delivered tomorrow. Will that be possible?,0
5748,What time exactly?,0
5749,I need it delivered at 12 o'clock.,0
5750,We can have it to you at that time.,0
5751,That's not a problem?,0
5752,We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock.,0
5753,That's great! Thank you very much.,4
5754,Can I help you?,0
5755,"Yes, I'm looking for a house.",0
5756,To buy or to rent?,0
5757,"Oh, to rent.",0
5758,How much do you want to pay?,0
5759,About 300 a month.,0
5760,"Well, I've got one here. It's 260 a month.",0
5761,How big is it?,0
5762,"It's got a kitchen, a bathroom, and one bedroom.",0
5763,"Well, actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible.",0
5764,"Yes, I think so. There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park.",0
5765,How much is it?,0
5766,It's 325 a month. It's the biggest we've got in this area.,0
5767,What's it like?,0

5769,It sounds interesting. Can I go and see it?,4
5770,"Of course, Sir.",0
5771,"Would you please mail these letters, Lucy?",0
5772,"Yes, Sir.",0
5773,These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail. Others are ordinary letters.,0
5774,"All right, who should I send them to?",0
5775,It’ s sent to Mr. Charles. I believe he is in London.,0
5776,"Ok, home or office address?",0
5777,"Office address, please. He might be at work when they arrive.",0
5778,Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters?,0
5779,"Yes, it’ s right.",0
5780,What are you reading?,0
5781,"Oh, it’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue. It’ s a sic-fi thriller.",0
5782,I thought he usually wrote horror books.,6
5783,He does. He’ s good at this genre too. It’ s a captivating read.,0
5784,We’ re going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us?,0
5785,"Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, as you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks.",0
5786,Me too. I need something to read on the flight to New York. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children’ s books for her daughter.,0
5787,I want to look at nelson Mandela’ s autobiography.,0
5788,This is sure to be a worthwhile read.,0
5789,"Doctor, I have the worst toothache!",5
5790,How long have you had this pain?,0
5791,"For about a week or so, but it’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days.",0
5792,Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth?,0
5793,"You know, I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day, and I accidentally bit down really hard on one.",0
5794,What kind of toothbrush do you use?,0
5795,I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush.,0
5796,Does it bother you when you eat something really cold?,0
5797,"Yes, it definitely bothers me more when I do that.",0
5798,Good evening.,0
5799,"Good evening.My wife and I would like a room, please.Is there any room available? We don't have a reservation.",0
5800,"Let me see.Yes, we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one.",0
5801,"Good.We ' re tired after driving all day, and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room.",0
5802,This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room.,0
5803,How much is it for one night? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning.,0
5804,It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you?,0
5805,"No, it's just the two of us.",0
5806,Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card?,0
5807,Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips.,0
5808,Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon.,0
5809,Thank you very much.,0
5810,"Thank you, sir.Enjoy your stay with us.",0
5811,Let's go to the animal shelter.,0
5812,What do you want to do?,0
5813,I want to get a puppy for my son.,0
5814,That will make him so happy.,0
5815,I'll get him one of those little dogs.,0
5816,One that won't grow up too big.,0
5817,And eat too much.,0
5818,Do you know which one he would like?,0
5819,"Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.",0
5820,I bet you had to drag him away.,0
5821,He wanted to take it home yesterday.,0
5822,I wonder what he'll name it.,0
5823,Hello. I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport.,0
5824,OK. Is it in the box? May I see it?,0
5825,Yes. This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor.,0
5826,Is there anything else?,0
5827,There are a mouse and a camera.,0
5828,Is that all?,0
5829,Yes. How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery?,0
5830,"It depends on the weight of these things. Generally speaking, we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram.",0
5831,"I see. Can you weigh them for me, please?",0
5832,Please go over there to weigh them.,0
5833,OK. See you later.,0
5834,what happened? Why didn't he win?,6
5835,didn't you hear? He was disqualified.,0
5836,how did that happen? He's so talented! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!,6
5837,"if he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.",0
5838,what? What kind of drugs was he using?,6
5839,he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.,0
5840,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.,0
5841,they are. The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.,0
5842,that's so disappointing. I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.,0
5843,"I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might. Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!",0
5844,"regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.",0
5845,"I agree. Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.",0
5846,let's hope so.,0
5847,I need to use the ATM.,0
5848,What’ s stopping you?,0
5849,I’ m not sure how.,0
5850,I don’ t understand.,0
5851,I’ Ve never used one before.,0
5852,I can help you figure it out.,0
5853,What do I have to do?,0
5854,Slide your card into the machine.,0
5855,Then what?,0
5856,You need to type your PIN in.,0
5857,What do I have to do next?,0
5858,"Click on whichever option you want, and you’ re done.",0
5859,"What are you doing? Checking the "" to do "" list for the wedding?",0
5860,Yep. There's still so much to do!,0
5861,So let's start by checking off what we've already done.,0
5862,Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests?,0
5863,"Not yet, I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net.",0
5864,Cool! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us!,4
5865,Hey! We're paying for his ticket!,0
5866,It is my first time coming to China. I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts.,0
5867,We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain. Do you like them?,4
5868,"Yes, I love them, but they are fragile. It is not convenient to take them.",0
5869,You are right. How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs?,4
5870,Sounds good. May I have a look?,4
5871,"Of course. These paintings have many designs, such as animals, flowers, landscape, aquatics and so on.",4
5872,"They are beautiful, but I can't understand the connotation in them. Let me see the handkerchiefs.",0
5873,All right. Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality.,4
5874,"Oh, I like the bamboo design. What is this?",0
5875,"This is a series of animals, called Chinese zodiac.",0
5876,Good. So I will take three series and five bamboo ones.,0
5877,"OK, I will wrap them for you.",4
5878,Excuse me.,0
5879,Yes?,0
5880,"Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram, please?",0
5881,Certainly. Go along Queen's Road...,4
5882,Along Queen's Road...,0
5883,"Yes, and turn right at the Hilton Hotel.",0
5884,Right at the Hilton.,0
5885,"Then go up Garden Road, past the Cathedral.",0
5886,The Cathedral?,0
5887,Yes. Then cross the road at the next traffic lights. The Peak Tram is straight ahead. You can't miss it.,0
5888,That's very kind of you. Thank you. Er... have you got a pencil?,4
5889,Yes. Why?,0
5890,Can you repeat all that? I think I'd better write it down.,0
5891,"Hi, Nally, are you hungry?",0
5892,I'm starving. Let's go grab a bite.,0
5893,Where to?,0
5894,How about Karlis?,0
5895,Are you kidding? That place is too ritzy for lunch.,6
5896,True. ok Let's go to Grumose?,0
5897,"Same thing, meals there all coarsen arm and leg.",0
5898,I guess it is a little pricy.,0
5899,Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch..,0
5900,"That will be Ok. Come on, I can't wait to chow down.",0
5901,"That was a great lunch, the food was good, but the service was lousy.",0
5902,Is that why you stiffed the waiter?,0
5903,"You got it. All right, Let's go back to school.",0
5904,"Good morning, sir.",0
5905,Good morning. I'd like a business suit made with this material.,0
5906,Do you have a particular style in mind?,0
5907,"The kind that never goes out of fashion, I guess.",0
5908,I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes.,0
5909,I'm sure you're right. I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year.,0
5910,The changes are usually not that dramatic. We just got some pictures of the latest fashion. Would you like to take a look?,0
5911,Good. I think I'll choose this single breasted one. When can I get it?,4
5912,Next Friday.,0
5913,Thank you.,4
5914,"Oh, gosh! I feel everything around me is against me.",5
5915,Don't take it too hard. There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010.,0
5916,"Well, I am all ears. Maybe they are helpful.",0
5917,"Firstly, you must always show your best to the interviewer. And secondly, try to avoid spamming through e-mails, because this will make the reader go crazy. The last but not the least, there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age.",0
5918,"I understand what you mean, and I will not upset myself. Face it.",0
5919,Good luck to us.,0
5920,"Look, Mary! There are so many people over there!",0
5921,"Oh, I remember, there is a job fair in the personnel market.",0
5922,I have never been to the personnel market.,0
5923,Really? I have been there several times.,6
5924,Are there many employers?,0
5925,Yes. The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers.,0
5926,"So there will be many large companies in the personnel market, right?",0
5927,"Yes, there are many famous corporations.",0
5928,When will there be a job fair?,0
5929,Every Saturday and Sunday,0
5930,Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market?,0
5931,"No, it's free.",0
5932,How about going there to have a look now?,0
5933,"OK, let's go.",0
5934,Could you show me the T-shirt on the model?,0
5935,"Here you are. We have three different colors, white, blue and pink.",0
5936,What's the price?,0
5937,$ 12.,0
5938,Can you make it any cheaper?,0
5939,It is cheap.,0
5940,I'll take it if you give me a discount.,0
5941,$ 10. That's the best I can do.,0
5942,OK. I'll take the blue one.,4
5943,"Hello, again. Did you discuss everything with your colleagues?",0
5944,"Yes, yes. It seems that everything is settled.",0
5945,Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid?,0
5946,"We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts, whether they are currently with this bank or not.",0
5947,That's not a problem.,0
5948,"Of course, if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank, or open new accounts with you.",0
5949,Thank you very much. We always welcome new customers.,4
5950,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking.,0
5951,We should plan to move out of here before July. I'm tired of living in apartments.,0
5952,"I know, dear. I am too. But we've just been too busy to look for a house.",0
5953,We need to find a good realtor.,0
5954,"Not necessarily. If we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive.",0
5955,What do you mean?,0
5956,"Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him.",0
5957,But doesn't a realtor help with the contract? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles.,0
5958,"Yes, that's often true. But you have to pay them.",0
5959,"I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country. We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also, the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has",0
5960,"Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems, I have friends. They can help us.",0
5961,So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor?,0
5962,It takes a little more time. We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them.,0
5963,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?,0
5964,"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.",0
5965,Why?,6
5966,"Because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor.",0
5967,Hmm. It all sounds very complicated.,0
5968,It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome.,0
5969,I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like.,0
5970,Alright. I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store.,0
5971,"Oh, so the zoo is over there. Thank you so much for your help.",0
5972,You’ re welcome. Can I ask you what brings you to China?,0
5973,I’ m actually travelling around Asia.,0
5974,"Oh, very nice. How long will you be in Beijing?",0
5975,Probably another week.,0
5976,"Oh, I see. Well, I’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide, please call me.",0
5977,Thank you very much. That’ s very kind.,4
5978,Are you interested in mountaineering?,0
5979,"Yes, in some sense. I should say I like mountain climbing, you know, because I'm not so professional. How about you",0
5980,"I'm the same with you, an amateur mountain climber. I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation. We spent two days in the mountains.",0
5981,How did you spend the night there?,0
5982,"We pitched a tent in the night, waiting for the sunrise. Wow! It was too beautiful.",0
5983,"I had a similar experience, but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country.",0
5984,"Tasha Mountain? It's very famous in China, isn't?",0
5985,Yes. It is one of the Five Mountains.,0
5986,I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation. Would you be my guide?,0
5987,I'd love to.,4
5988,"Sir, what's wrong with you?",0
5989,I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness.,0
5990,Have you ever suffered from airsickness before? You're probably airsick.,0
5991,"No, this is the first time on a plane. Maybe you are right.. Please get me some pills.",0
5992,"OK. I will get some for you. There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment. ( Go away for a few minutes, and now she comes back. ) Here are two pills. And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water.",0
5993,Thank you very much. ( Take the pills. ),0
5994,Are you feeling better now?,0
5995,Much better now. Thanks again.,4
5996,My pleasure.,4
5997,"Good morning, Madam. What can I do for you?",0
5998,Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts?,0
5999,Maybe sandalwood fan is good.,0

6009,"Good morning! Can you help me, please? I'm looking for some books for my mother.",0
6010,"Well, what kind of books does she like?",0
6011,She's very fond of detective stories?,0
6012,I see.Has she read any detective stories?,0
6013,"Oh, yes!",0
6014,Do you know if she's read this one?,0
6015,"I'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!",0
6016,Ah! She has a bad memory.How old is she?,0
6017,She's eighty-seven.,0
6018,I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting.,0
6019,Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one?,4
6020,"Hey, Jimmy, you've been sitting in front of the TV all day. Anything interesting on TV?",0
6021,"Not really. Quite boring right now, actually. Mostly infomercials and public service announcements.",0
6022,Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside? You need to get some fresh air.,0
6023,"I know, I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes. It's the series finals, and I wouldn't miss it for the world!",0
6024,Really? What's the series about?,0
6025,"Well, it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America. It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. I think you'd like it.",0
6026,"It sounds interesting, but I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth.",0
6027,"I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, with hilarious results.",0
6028,Really? that's interesting!,4
6029,"Yeah.Oh, here it comes! why don't we watch it together? they are going to have a court debate in this episode. It should be good.",4
6030,"OK, I'll give it a go.",4
6031,"Hello, hot water overflowed from the bathtub. Would you help me?",0
6032,Would you turn off the tap?,0
6033,I did it.,0
6034,Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door.,0
6035,"Ok, I will.",0
6036,I will have our housekeeper come right away.,0
6037,"I am sorry, I was too tired to fall asleep.",0

6561,"Hey there Chris, what are you up to?",0
6562,I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models.,0
6563,"Oh, so you're thinking about buying a new car?",0
6564,"Yeah, it looks that way. My wife has been bugging me about it. I thought we could probably survive without one, but with a baby on the way, maybe it is time to get a car.",0
6565,So this would be your first automobile?,0
6566,"That's right. For quite a few years, I rode a bicycle to work. Then I got a motorbike.",0
6567,"Yeah, I think I can understand your wife's position. Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order.",0
6568,"Oh... I don't let her ride with me. It's just too dangerous. She takes the bus to work, but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot.",0
6569,"So it's time to buy your very first car! Wow, that's exciting!",4
6570,"Yes, but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility.",0
6571,Yeah. I still remember my first car. It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17. I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car.,0
6572,I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us.,0
6573,"Yeah, it is a tough call. Each one has its pros and cons. Are you looking for a sedan?",0
6574,"Yes, I'd like a Jeep, but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives.",0
6575,I'd advise you to listen to your wife. She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice.,0
6576,Can I help you?,0
6577,I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen.,0
6578,Is it a photograph or a document?,0
6579,Each of both.,0
6580,Could I see both of them?,0
6581,Here you are.,0
6582,You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send. The photograph is all right.,0
6583,"Well, how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen?",0
6584,Couple of minutes.,0
