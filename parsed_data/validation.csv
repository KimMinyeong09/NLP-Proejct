A 10 % commission will not leave us much. According to your estimate, what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill, in round figures, of course? We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business, as our remuneration increases with the turnover, but we will not guar - ante anything, at least not to begin with. We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products. But our suggestion to you, Mr. Bergeron, as a preliminary step, is to do a little research into the market...",0,Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency?,0
105,"Mr. Bergeron, you leave us no alternative. We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover.

I intended to make great efforts in selling your products. Well, we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement. To start the ball rolling, we will provide you with price lists, catalogues and some samples.

So how do you usually go about buying shoes, then? Well, first of all, I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection. Well, you're in the right store. If they don't have it, no one will.",0,"After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me.

642,"Do you think we should travel by bus or by train? It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster, but much more expensive. We could face delays if we travel by bus, thanks to traffic jams. Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around.",0,That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus.,0
643,"Really? I think you see more traveling by train. So which form of transport do you prefer to use? I prefer going by train, even though it costs more. Ok, then we'll go by train. I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets?",0,"The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets, because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles.",0

647,"Now darling, I know that we've bought this house together, but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it. I think we should sell it. Oh, no, Nathan, I... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know.Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more. But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished. But don't you like this place? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.",0,"Well, only you liked it really, darling.",0
648,"Hi, Bob, everything okay? More or less. There's just one thing bothering me. Oh? What's that? Well, you know I have some students studying for their master's degree. One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy.",0,What gift?,0
649,"It's an Egyptian carpet. The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude. Seeing what gift was, I was really uncomfortable. I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor. I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift, so I refused it. You refused the gift? That's terrible. I know, but I really can't accept such an expensive gift. I explained to him why, but he seemed really upset about it. I think he might have taken it the wrong way. Perhaps. He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade.",0,That's what I am worried about. I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored. But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor. I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page.,0
650,"I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet. We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym. Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit? You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the same thing.",0,"Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?",0
651,"The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir. Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations? The swim stations are open daily from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. Boy, oh boy!

662,I really want to make something for dinner. What are you going to cook? I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make. A teriyaki bowl sounds nice.,4,I don't know how to make that.,0
663,"All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef. That sounds fairly simple, but how do I cook it? The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice. What's next?",0,Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it.,0
664,"Good morning! Can I speak to Miss Cooper please? Would you hold on a second, please? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged. Engaged. Oh, dear! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call?",6,"I'm sorry, sir. I can't interrupt her. I'm sure she won't be very long.",0

684,"What's our target audience for this campaign? This go-around we're focusing on new moms, families with median income and one or more children under the age of two. Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for? Well, there are some similarities that come up.

691,And? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. And it's a brick? Yes.,0,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,0
692,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new.

I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that.",0,You mean you want to run the meetings?,0
709,"No, not really run them. But I could help organize them. I could discuss meeting topics with you, and then prepare a schedule for each meeting. I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused, and people would prepare better. Hmm. But we would meet every two weeks. I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer, and better organized. I am not against the idea, Arnold.It may really be more efficient, as you say. I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month, and see how it works.",0,Excellent. I would be happy to get started on it.,4
