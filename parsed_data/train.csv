5,"Let’ s see... you’ re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we’ ll both have interesting summers! That’ s bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. No, it’ s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’ re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?",0,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical.

10,"Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her. No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen. It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids. My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.",0,You said she used to? How did you stop her?,0

49,That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank. Good. I will have hot chocolate. A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green. When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you.,0,Sorry. How far is the museum?,0

51,"I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. Really? Are you sure? Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back. Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!",0,Really?,6
52,"Excuse me, what's the screen near your steering wheel for? It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now. Oh, that's new to me. So what's on everyday? News about current affairs, documentaries, music, movies, noncommercial ads and so on.",0,Is there anything interesting?,0
53,"Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?",0,Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.,0

I'll call you Saturday morning.,4
59,"What upsets you? My parents called. As usual, they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier said then done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date. It is not your mother finding one for you? I will find one myself, of course. I’ m a modern girl.",0,"Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, the latest type.",0
60,"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea. No, there is an updated virgin, three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes. I don’ t think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time. I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, so-called love at first sight.",0,"Anyway, I don’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.",2
61,"Are you going to the party on Saturday? I was thinking about it. Are you? Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun. Really? Well, what time does it start?",6,It starts at 8,0

64,"I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve? I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis. Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right? I'll try ; it's hard!",0,Thanks for stopping by!,0
65,"Oh, my God! I've been cheated! What? What did you buy? It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it! What is it? Why did you buy a brick?",0,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",1
66,And? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. And it's a brick? Yes.,0,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,6
67,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?",0,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
68,"Hey, Mary, what's up? Just so so. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time, so we decided to meet again tonight. Oh, that's exciting. What does this guy look like? Is he hot? Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! And we have so much in common. We like the same team, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.",0,It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?,4
69,"What’ s up? You don’ t look too good. Yeah, my head hurts, that’ s all. I’ Ve been in physics class all day. It’ s killer! I liked physics. It’ s all math, really. arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. Yeah, yeah, but today’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.",0,A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’ s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.,0
70,"It’ s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’ s what the math says. Math, sheath. What’ s the evidence? There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!",0,"Anyway, it’ s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’ s the scientific rigor in that?",0
71,"Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning. But people have different views about lifelong learning. How do you understand lifelong learning? I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning Does that mean studying all the time? I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors.",0,Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer.,0
72,"You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active. Me too. To keep up with the changing world, one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things. You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.",0,Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.,6
73,It smells like an ashtray in here! Hi honey! What’ s wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? What’ s wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking. No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!,0,"Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It’ s not like you can just light up like before.",1
74,"It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy. I get antsy not because you praise a guy, but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him. How come you think of him that way? Because you seem to have lost your vigilance. You should be on the watch out.",2,I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm.,0
75,"Have you signed up to join the company’ s Christmas party? Sure, I have. Will you join? I will. You know, as a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere. You are right. Our company’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.",0,I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.,0

79,"What’ s the life expectancy in your country? I’ m not sure, but probably about 75 years. How about in your country? About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world. I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.",0,Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.,0
80,"Did she? That’ s great. However, if we have too many children, that will have a bad effect on the enviroment. How’ s your son these days? Oh, he’ s fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays. He’ ll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child?",0,"I had mine when I was 24. that’ s a little young. I’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.",0
81,"Yes, I think you’ re right. I’ m thinking about having a child, but not just yet. Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country? Yes, there is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don’ t often succeed. Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.",0,"It’ s almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, they might go wild.",0

92,"Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think. Did you do you own stunts in the movie? I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn’ t let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I’ ll leave that to the experts in future.

I’ m just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can’ t handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica.

111,My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another. She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay. It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do. But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more? It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment.,0,What time is the right moment?,0
112,"are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night? of course. Is the dinner still on? yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place. we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice.",0,"that's what I thought you would do.

113,"it can't be that bad. I wish it wasn't, but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here. really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime. do me a favor, and take a taxi.

117,"What do you make of the case? If you ask me, I don’ t think it’ s guilty. What do you mean by saying so? I mean it’ s not his fault.",0,"Oh, yeah?",0
118,I have a real problem when I meet people. What is it? Maybe I can help. I never know when to shake hands and when not to. Can you tell me something about it? Do you come from a country where they shake hands?,0,"Oh yes. Men, women, and children shake hands all the time.",0
119,"It’ s very simple. Men shake hands, women and children don’ t. But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, they shake hands too. Well, a good rule to follow is, for men you hold out your hand, for women and children, you wait and see what they do. That sounds easy enough.",4,"Sure. Once you get the hang of it, it’ s a piece of cake! It’ s nothing to worry about.",4
120,"Sam, I am so sorry. It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it. Don't worry about it. I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well.

Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us.",0,"Oh, yes, I know the one. How was the food?",0
121,"The food was excellent, but Jane ordered a birthday cake, which they forgot about. So as you can see, you were not the only one. Oh, no. Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, but still...

122,"I can't believe Mr. Fro didn't buy it. Who does that guy think he is anyway? Bill Gates? He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked. Time to order. Balista, today I want a skinny triple latte. When did you start worrying about your weight?",0,I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat?,0

We’ ll be at the front of the line soon. Two tickets, please. How much are they? Oh no, Ari. I didn’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let’ s go Dutch. I’ ll pay my own way. I insist.",0,I’ m looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning’ s newspaper.,0
124,"Do you often buy magazines? I buy a computer magazine every month. It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments. Why don’ t you find the information on the internet instead? Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes.",0,Do you have an online edition of that magazine?,0
125,"Mumm. Those burgers smell great. It's perfect day for a barbecue. It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way. Oh, hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. What's your name again?",4,"Barbara. But please, just call me Barb.",4

128,"There are tons of other paintings that I think are better. Maybe so, but do you have any idea how much this one is worth? No, how much is it worth? About 80 million dollars.",4,Whoa.,6
129,"hey, Maris, are you a part-timer? part-timer? Is that a new buzzword? oh, it’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you? sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender.",0,cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!,4
130,"yeah, but I’ m not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset. that’ s true. I’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job? of course. There’ s always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world. you mean you got working experience, right?",0,not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.,0

134,"Jim, how was your weekend? I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there. That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you go swimming, too? Sure. I think it’ s a fantastic place to go.",4,I couldn’ t agree more. That’ s an ideal place for a vacation.,4
135,We're having a sixties party next week. Do you want to come? What is a sixties party? You come dressed in anything from the sixties. That sounds like fun. But where can I get clothes that old?,4,Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something.,4
136,"I want to improve my handwriting, and I've practiced it for several weeks, but nothing happened. You see, my handwriting is still bad. Oh, come on. You know it's a long process, you have to be patient. I know it, but I don't know when I can make it better. A, whatever you do, the most important is perseverance. So you have to hang on there, the longer, the better. Then some day, you will find you've already made a lot of progress.",0,"Yeah, you are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day.",4
137,"I’ m so excited, mother. Oh, a new baby! My first grandchild. And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, mum. He does. Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, he’ s got Richard’ s eyes though.",4,"Yes, he does have Richard’ s eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.",4
138,The music has started. How do you like this waltz? It's very nice. May I ask you for a dance?,4,Certainly.,4
139,"Do you speak only English in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish? Oh, we never speak Spanish in class! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English.

141,"What did you do? I didn't do anything. Finally, he left.But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's.

142,"He followed me all the way home! That's about five blocks. And around corners too.So he was definitely following you. Yes, he was. I'm not imagining it.Finally, just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious.What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police? Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again, then maybe you should call.",0,Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!,3
143,"Han Maimed, What's your plan for the weekend? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It’ s better to get to know it. What about you? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays. Oh, my God! John, I didn’ t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.",6,"Come on, Han Maimed, don’ t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.",0
144,"But I’ m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they? Yes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world. I've heard about it a little bit before, but I don’ t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist? That’ s a little complicated. You’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people’ s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.",0,Really?,6
145,Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England. Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans. How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?,6,"That’ s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.",0
146,"So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England? Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College. Why did they want to found a college? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.",0,"Oh, I see.",0
147,"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ', without a formal name. When did it begin to be called Harvard University? In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman. It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.",0,"Therefore, it’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard.",0
148,"Wow, I didn’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S. I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard. Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.",0,That’ s right. I have a lot to learn from you.,4
149,"What do you do in summer? I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? I don’ t often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. What do you do in winter?",0,"Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I’ m feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.",0
150,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? Pardon? What university would you enter? University? Why? You asked me last year.",6,"Oh, I forget.Sorry.",0
151,"I went to Harvard University. Did you? And what course did you take there? God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you? I've not known.Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.",0,I did a B. A. in economics.Remember?,0
152,I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion. Fun for you! Do you get to do anything you want? Yep. And I should start planning now. Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions?,0,Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone.,0
153,"Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia. Nice to meet you, Lvan.My name is Alike. I'm from Japan. To me English is a difficult language. A second language is always difficult.",0,"True, but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language.",0

155,"What’ s up? You don’ t look too good. Yeah, my head hurts, that’ s all. I’ Ve been in physics class all day. It’ s killer! I liked physics. It’ s all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. Yeah, yeah, but today’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.",0,A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’ s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.,6
156,"It’ s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’ s what the math says. Math, sheath. What’ s the evidence? There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!",0,"Anyway, it’ s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’ s the scientific rigor in that?",0
157,"Which film shall we see? There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert? Yes, I'd love to.Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there? Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?",0,"No, I'm not hungry.",0
158,"Bill, how can you hear so happy today? Aha. I've read of my roommate. I made a move today. Really? What was the matter? You knew Brain Locker?",0,"Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?",0
159,"Hey! How was your first day of class? I’ m in level two and I’ m loving my class this semester! It’ s great being in a class of international students! Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. That’ s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’ s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, That’ s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and o",0,"Well, I think you’ re pretty lucky actually. You’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.",0
160,"Good morning, Miss Li. Morning, Mike. I’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday. I’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave. How do you feel today?",0,I feel much better now.,0
161,"Do you like flowers? Of course, I like. What's your favorite flower? Forsythia. It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival.",4,Spring is a lively season.,4
162,Yes. How about you? I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter. You have a perfect taste! It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms.,4,But it used to be ignored by many people.,0
163,"What is the weather like today? It stops snowing, but there's a bit wind. And the streets are covered with ice. Do you know what the temperature is today? I missed today's weather for cast in the radio",0,"It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, but do hate when it get slippery.",0
164,"What kind of music do you like listening to? I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don’ t you? Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work. I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.",0,Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.,0
165,Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. Yes. That’ s why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I’ m cooking or doing other housework. I’ Ve got a few classical music CD’ s. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power. You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.,0,"That’ s a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.",4
166,"There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street. I hope that they have a good menu. Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish. That's right. You don't drink coffee, do you?

He likes children and always wants a child of his own.",6,"In fact, they’ re both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.",4
168,"Well, I am a regular member of this club. Do you have to pay to join? Yes, membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars. Wow, that much? Don't they have any public courses?",6,"Very few, unfortunately.",0

They use too much water.",0,I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.,0

Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn’ t get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section. Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good, good. This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note. Now let’ s take a look at this Charles?

Your plane was three hours late! we finally took off, but about 30 minutes later, the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight. turbulence is pretty normal, isn't it?",0,"yes, but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life! Everyone started getting sick. The flight attendants had to stay in their seats. The captain decided to land early.",0
279,so where did you land? we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again. that sounds like a nightmare! it wasn't too bad. At lease I'm alive.,0,have you had anything to eat?,0

284,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York, to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida. That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there. But if the sunshine is too strong, it might damage the eyes and the skin. You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer.",0,I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.,0

The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage. What do you mean?",0,"Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don’ t go together.",2
294,"I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities. People can’ t have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, but there’ s more to do. I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They’ re so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings. I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.",4,The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There’ s so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.,4

Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, they should give you some kind of compensation.",6

But I’ m sure you’ re able to find a balance between them. Why not try it? I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I’ m a senior now, I don’ t want to miss the chance this time.

And my internship will last 1 week. I'm still a student now. Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here?",0,"Of course not. You know, there are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English.",0

Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life.

374,"Is your city a historical place? Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. How did it grow into such a large place?

Real hackers call these people crackers, and want nothing to do with them.",0,So they are two totally different concepts.,0
410,"Well, the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible and not very bright, and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer.

416,"What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space? I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left. It was just awe-inspiring. It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth, where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance. I wasn't quite prepared for that. It's inevitably etched in my memory. When viewing the Earth from space, do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind? Detached.

Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner? I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell. You had gone to the moon twice, orbited space around the Earth lots of times, and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait.",0,"If I were the man making the decisions, you could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future.",0
418,Where did you go yesterday? I went to play tennis in the public park. How often do you play tennis? Twice a week. How about you?,0,I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.,0

Yeah, he often scores by free kicks in crucial games. But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks. Certainly not. What really counts is to play as a team, passing the ball amongst each other, dodging defenders. Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However, a few free kicks often make everything different, especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time.",0,"In the case, maybe facial charm should be his leading card. After all, the majority of his fans are girls.",0
464,May I have a word with you? Certainly. When will you be free? Come by any time.,0,Shall I say around ten o'clock?,4
465,"Congratulations! Mr. Stuart! You won the city marathon. Thank you. I am very excited. We are all very proud of you. I am very happy, too. It was a big game and I won.",4,I watched the race with my children. We saw you run to the finish line. We all screamed with excitement.,4
466,"Are you ok, Chuck? You look pale. I'm fine, Katherine. I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese. Oh, poor you. You know what? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well. You did? Do tell me. I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it, but I've made little progress!",0,Sure. I'm learning Chinese through songs.,0
467,So you're learning Chinese songs? You can say that. I can actually sing some of them now. That's a real achievement. How did you do that? I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer.,0,It makes sense.,0
468,"It does. I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way. They are clearly presented and easy to follow. Can Join you, Katherine? I do want to have a try. Why not? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now. Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary?",0,"Yes, just in case we run into me new characters.",0
469,"Where to, miss? Hi! Crenshaw and Hawthorne, at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner. Sure thing. So, where are you flying in from? From China.",0,"Really? You don’ t look very Chinese to me, if you don’ t mind me saying so.",6
470,"It’ s fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products. Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you? Don’ t you know it’ s rude to ask a lady her age? Don’ t get me wrong! It’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!",0,"Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself?",4
471,"Have you thought of moving at all, Sarah? We’ Ve thought about it, but my husband and I can’ t afford it right now. The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums, which is something I don’ t want to do. Buying a house can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses. Like what?",0,"Well, sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community. You’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, but you would definitely save money doing it that way.",0
472,"That’ s a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before? Sure, my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They’ re pretty satisfied with it. Is the house pretty run-down. Not at all. The woman, who owned it, took good care of it. But when she died, she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.",0,Was it a very old house?,0
473,"Do Mona and Jim need a new house? No, they have a big new fancy house. Does Jim make a lot of money? Yes, he does. He is a science fiction writer.",0,Does Jim need to make more money?,0
474,"Afraid so. The more the better. What do they need all that money for? Well, they spend it pretty quick. New clothes, new computers and new cars every year. And they’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress, she likes to spend a lot of money. Do they have any children?",0,No. They want children but no luck yet.,0
475,"What does Jim like to do? Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money. What does Mona like to do? Oh, she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, and she has quite a bit of jewelry.",0,Wow... She sounds like a high maintenance wife.,0
476,I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government. Politics can be an expensive hobby. She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps. Politics is a hard game to play.,0,She might do well. Everyone seems to like her.,0
477,"Are you alright, child? Hey, I still know my name. What did the nurse say? She said I have a fever but nothing major.",0,"In that case, you should go home and get plenty of rest.",0
478,"Who was the best teacher that you ever had? That would have to be Miss Baymler, my fourth grade teacher. What was she like? She was patient, kind, fun, smart, caring, and yet strict, too. I really learned a lot from her.",4,What kind of things did you learn?,0
479,"She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do. Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything? If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it. You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules?",0,"She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, the students had to treat each other with respect, or they would be disciplined.",0
480,"I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students. Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don’ t have any teacher’ s pets. Really? Doesn’ t every teacher have a teacher’ s pet? Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn’ t treat me any differently. She really didn’ t have any teacher’ s pets.",0,Do you know what she is doing now?,0
481,"As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, she got married and moved to another city. Then, she started writing children’ s book. Have you ever read one of the books? Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books. Why don’ t you recommend one to me?",0,ok! I’ ll bring one to you next time.,4
482,"Look, daddy is on again. Don't you think he is handsome? To some extent, he is. And what do you think we move to a better place? I can't see him clearly from here. The seats in the middle of this stadium are great, but they're already occupied by somebody else. Oh, thank you for pointing that out. By the way, have you been following NBA for this season?",4,"Of course, tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game.",0
483,"Who plays who? Rockets vs Lakers. Yao Ming, my idol, will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience. It's amazing. And when did he begin to play in the NBA? In 2002. And since then he has attracted more attention than ever.",0,I can't consider you as a little kid any more. I know he is very tall.,0
484,"Oh, you know something. He is 2.26 meters tall. But he is also nimble and skillful. I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game. Yes, what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game. That's really terrible. Oh, God, we forgot to cheer for Daddy.",0,"Never mind. After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming, right?",0
485,"What’ s the date today? December the fifteenth. The day after tomorrow is little Tom’ s birthday. Right. What present should we give him this time? By the way, how old is he? Thirteen today and tomorrow. Fourteen the day after tomorrow.",0,How time flies! He’ s a big boy now.,0
486,"Do you hear what happened to Sally? No, what? She had to go to the hospital. Why?",0,She passed out in class. Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days.,0
487,"Why on earth would she do that? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days? That's crazy! Yeah, but that's what she did. I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies. And all for a certain look. Well, it's not just the girl’ s fault. It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying, It's in to be thin. It's hard for them not to listen.",0,"True, but there are limits. Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another. No one forces them to do this.",0
488,"Have you found another job yet, Sally? No, I haven't, but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper. What kind of job are you looking for? Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel.",0,You haven't had any experience in either of those fields.,0
489,"Hi. Are you new in this class? Yes, I am. I really don't know anyone. My name is Steven. What's your name? My name is Bill. How are your lessons going?",0,Very well. And my favorite subject is Chinese.,0
490,"Robert, this is my friend, Mrs. Smith. Hi, Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Mrs. Smith, what do you do for work?",0,I'm a doctor.,0

She probably wouldn't even recognize me. She's probably married. Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you. So get out there, Tiger!",0,Was she really? So you're telling me there's a chance?,0
493,"Oh, Ralph, I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space. Disasters have happened before. If the spaceship were out of order... You should be optimistic about this. Things have taken a good turn. You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible. But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors? It's once in blue moon.",0,What do you think is the real danger man faced in space?,0
494,"Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work. What a life! I've had enough of it. Cool down, man. Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic. But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. What should I do then? I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour.",4,"I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, polled air on the road?",2
495,"How many people are there in your family? Five. Besides my parents and me, there are my brother and sister. That’ s a big family. How old is your brother? Eighteen.",0,What about your sister?,0

497,"What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps. I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated. Come on, nothing can be that bad. But promise me, you'll keep it a secret.",0,"Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?",0
498,"I've fallen in love with my boss. Really? Is he married? Bo, of course not. He is still single. Then what's your problem?",0,I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.,5
499,"Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip. Worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days. Office romance is very tricky. It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.",5,"Cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.",0
500,How may I help you? I want to return this video. Is that all you need? I also need to check these books out.,0,Anything else?,0

So what?",0,"You know how much I want to be on the team, and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance.",0
504,"I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, and I did. I know, and I will. When? After baseball practice.",0,"And then, it'll be dinner time, then homework, and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise.",0
505,"What stresses you out the most? Probably my parents. How so? Well, during school, they wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job. And finally, they want me to get married.",0,You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents.,0
506,"Your parents are not like that? Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much. You're lucky. What do you do to deal with the stress?",0,"Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, but that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning.",0
507,What's the weather like? I don't know. I just woke up. Why don't you look outside? Okay. It looks like rain.,0,Why do you say that?,0

Oh, Goodness, please not again.That ' s what we did last week. No, we didn't. Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness. Right, it was a chick flick, just like this one, so what's the difference? Besides, this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen. Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen.",0,"Oh, yeah, and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie, didn't you?",0
514,"Oh, sure, it was great. I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap. It wasn't that bad, and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant. That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much. And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken.",0,"But when I pick the restaurant, we go to a place that has both chicken and fish. I always respect your food preferences.",0

516,She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down. How about your new co-workers? They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work. Do you miss your old co-workers?,0,Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.,0
517,"Do people in different departments get along with each other? Sure. Since we work together in teams, we have to get along with each other.

It seems they will never end.",0,How do you think they could be ended?,0
552,"I don’ t think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that. So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them. It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it’ s harder to make peace between countries. Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support.

597,"The World Cup! The first match is today! It’ s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’ s going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all. I have no idea what you’ re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl. This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals.

Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me. What are you talking about? How does it exploit people? Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.",0,"Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’ t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’ t become addicted or anything like that.",0

613,"Oh... football. Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals. No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer. Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there. So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?",0,"Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?",0
614,"Julia, what's the weather forecast for tomorrow? It says a storm may come tomorrow. Oh! I hate rainy days! Me, too. I'm always in low spirits when it rains. Are you going out tomorrow?",0,Yes. I have to drive to Washington D. C.,0
615,"Thanks for offering to give me a lift. I'm looking forward to this party, but I didn't want to go alone. Don't mention it. It's my pleasure. Have you been to one of these large, sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven? No, this is my first. Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home.

I was there at two o'clock, but most people didn't arrive until three or four. They didn't start cooking until five o’ clock.",0
616,"Cookouts often start slowly. A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two. Thanks for telling me this. I was late getting back from the mall, but I'm hurrying.

617,"Some people are always closing their handsets, so it's difficult to inform them. Why not send them short messages? Can short messages reach them? Short messages will be kept in the short messages center. Once they open the handsets they will receive them, which is better than you can't find them.",0,Why haven't I thought of this skill?,4
618,"Hi! How are you going? Fine, thank you. How are you doing this morning? Not bad. How about you? Haven't seen you for a long time. Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday.",0,Did you enjoy yourself?,0
619,"Hello? Hi Tina, It's Joe. Hi Joe. How's the weather there today?",0,It's really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.,0
620,What's the temperature? It's 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning. Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.,0,I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.,0

624,"Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK? I don’ t know. I didn’ t really feel like going out. I guess I’ m feeling a little homesick. Come on. We’ Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. I was. It’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’ t be able to home because I can’ t afford the airfare. I’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’ s cooking and being around my family.",0,"Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.",0
625,"I see what you mean, but I’ m still bummed out. OK. how does this sound, let’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

I'm going to New York to visit my sister. She is in art school. I've never been to New York before. I'm kind of scared. Why? Well, I know a lot of people have guns there. I think maybe it isn't too safe.",0,"Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there, she must know the city pretty well already.",0
627,"Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little. Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see?

634,"I'm really curious. What is it like doing housework all day for a living? It's a little like being a mom, only I get paid for it!

650,"well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy. i guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat. yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, don't you? you bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.",0,"well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.",0
651,What's up? You look low. It's my girlfriend. I guess she's playing the army game. How come? I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again.,5,I understand that. But I think maybe it's not a date. You are taking the matter too much to heart.,0
652,"Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday? Yes, I did. I heard that they took both drivers to hospital. One needed surgery. Yes. I heard he had a few broken bones too, but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems. The second driver was luckier. He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound.",0,Yes. He was released from hospital yesterday evening. The other man could be there for weeks.,0
653,"I want to meet you. Are you free this evening? Well, actually, I'm not free today. Do you have anything urgent? No, I just want to meet you. How about tomorrow instead.",0,"Hmm, that's all right. Shall we meet at the bar near the beach?",0
654,"Do you have any tissue, Eve? I've used all mine. Here. Are you all right? Thanks. I am all right. It's just my nose. It must be an allergy. Do you have any aspirin? I have a terrible headache. I don't have an aspirin. Perhaps you should go to a doctor.",0,"No, no. I am okay. It's the weather. It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining.",0
655,"Really, John. I still think you should go to a doctor. You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning. Why don't you take this afternoon off? If you don't want to see a doctor, at least you can go home and have a good rest. I can't. I am already behind the schedule. Besides, you know Mr. White. He would think that I was putting him on. You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning, and you can't do anything this afternoon like this. Gee! You've got a fever. Do I? Oh, no.",0,Listen to me. You go home now. I will call my doctor and have him go over. Ok?,0
656,"How's your work? Good, thanks. How about you? Not bad. But we have lost a few of staff lately. Why?",0,Because of the low salaries.,0
657,"Good morning, Linda. How have you been? Pretty bad. I’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can’ t get rid of it. I’ m sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can do? No, thanks.",0,"Well, I hope you’ ll feel better soon.",0
658,"Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend? I'm not really into racecar driving. You were when we were in high school. That, and baseball. Yeah, well, times change. Look at you-you're a father now. You can't say that you haven't changed.",0,"True, but I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now.",0
659,"I can't believe it! I lost. It looks like you have to buy tickets for us, Jason. And we're not going to see an action movie! That's not fair, you got all the easy questions. I guess that's just the luck of the draw.",0,I want a rematch. Let's play again.,0
660,"do you need a hand? no, I can handle it. Thanks anyway. are you sure you don't need any help? well, maybe just a little. I can't seem to make it fit.",0,"I swear, the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller!",0
661,"that's so true. thanks for your help. Are you in the aisle seat in this row? yes. What about you? I'm in the middle seat. oh, I guess I'll let you through then.",0,thanks. sorry for making you get out of your seat again.,4
662,"that's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one? no, not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian? I prefer the British paper, but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away. I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, so the Guardian is all yours.",0,thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum?,0
663,"Man, I’ m freaking out! You gotta help me! Whoa, whoa, take it easy, relax. Geez, you’ re sweating like a pig! What’ s going on? I can’ t go through with this! I just can’ t! I’ m not ready for marriage! What was I thinking? I’ m only thirty five years old! I’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me, adventures waiting! I can’ t settle down yet! What are you talking about? It wasn’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family!",0,I know. I know!,0
664,"Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. How come? It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.",5,I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?,0
665,Who's that over here? That's the new teacher. What do you think of the teacher? She's very nice.,0,What does she teach?,0
666,"English, of course. Is she your teacher? Yes. She teaches our class three times a week. Can she speak Chinese to her students?",0,Not very much.,0
667,"Hello? Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing? Oh, hi. I was just watching TV. There's nothing to watch right now.",0,I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.,0
668,"Me too. Let's get together and do something. I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow? Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow. Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?",0,I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.,4
669,That's great. We can do something outdoors then. Are there any special events going on tomorrow? Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow. Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.,0,Do you know what time it starts?,0
670,"Would you go to the bookstore with me? It sounds a good idea. Let’ s go. Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel? Yes. I heard about that. And I know you want to buy it, but I’ m not interested in detective novels.",0,So what are you interested in?,0
671,When can we expect you for dinner? Can you come tonight? Not tonight. I promised to go to a concert with my sister. Well... How about Friday then? That sounds fine.,4,Good. Shall we say seven o'clock?,4
672,"I don’ t understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you’ Ve got good news everyday. Really? Do I look happy all the time? All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers. Oh, do you know why? Actually, it’ s easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!",0,"Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you.",0
673,"Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It’ s difficult and boring. It’ s true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week. But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’ t students want to have a good memory? Of course. I didn’ t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?",0,"Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.",0
674,"Which kind of sport do you like to watch? Basketball, football, table tennis. I will watch them on TV. So you must like NBA game. Yeah, it is my favorite. Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game. I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian, the Chinese players in NBA.",0,What kind of sport do you like to participate in?,0
675,"I am good at tennis and skiing. What about you? I prefer the indoor sports, such as bowling, badminton and squash. Moderate exercise is really important for health. ' Life lies in movement. ' How about playing tennis with me?",4,Good idea. I will take the racket.,4
676,Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get started using these machines? Of course. Are you a new member here? Yes. Welcome. My name is Johnson.,0,Nice to meet you.,0
677,"Do you have any experience using weights? No, I don't. So I need some help. Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines. Yes, I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.",0,Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.,0
678,"What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one. No. Not that. I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here, let me show you. I'm ready. Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.",0,I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.,0
679,"Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you. Alright. Great. So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here. Great. Why don't we start on the machines?",0,Are you alright? Can you do more?,0
680,"I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted. That's okay. Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning. What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines. We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?",0,Yes. I suppose it's best to stop.,0
681,"what are you doing? I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle. Whenever I get the time, I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper. you really like brains that make you think, don't you? I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like?",0,I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at!,0
682,"Doesn't everyone? Which games are those? Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours. Did you play a lot of games when you were little? My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend.",0,Do you still like playing those games?,0
683,"Not at all. I never really did, to be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together? Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games. Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that? No, I prefer to play with people I know.",0,How about mah-jong?,0
684,Can you believe that Susan got married? Really? I remember she said if she would remain single. Is the man very rich? No. That’ s what is surprising me. You means she didn’ t marry a rich man.,0,He’ s a postman.,0
685,"Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Sit down, please.How are you? I'm very well, thank you.How are you? Very well too, thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day?",4,"Yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot.",0
686,Yes. What's the weather like in your country? Mm... It's quite warm now. Where do you live?,0,In London.Where do you live?,0
687,What a great weekend that was! My feelings exactly. I really enjoy the beach in the summer. I couldn't agree with you more.,4,We should come here more often.,4
688,"We've got a new manager in our department. Oh? You hoped to get that job, didn't you? Yes, I did. I'm sorry. That's too bad. Who is it? Who got the job, I mean?",0,"Someone called Drexler. Carl Drexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job, too",0
689,"Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you? Because I'm the wrong sex, of course! You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman? Yes, that was probably it! It isn't fair.",1,What sort of clothes does he wear?,0
690,"A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why? Perhaps that had something to do with it. You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater? It's possible, isn't it?",0,Do you really think I should wear different clothes?,0
691,Well... perhaps you should think about it. Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress? I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all! Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing!,1,Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. But it isn't. Not in this company.,0
692,"It's a sunny day, isn't it? Yes, it is. I'm Jennifer. Nice to meet you. My name is David. Nice to meet you, too. Are you American?",0,"No, I'm a Britisher. Where do you come from?",0

694,"You keep bowling spares but no strike. I don't know why, but I think there's something wrong with my hands. I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball. I don't think it was the problem with your hands, you did several excellent spares. You have no problem with your hands. Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball?",0,"The problem is you are too nervous. You want to have a strike so much, so you deliver the ball too hard. And when it comes to the I second roll, there's no pressure. That's why you could bowl all those spares.",0
695,Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon? No I'm afraid not. I'm meeting Ruth then. How about the fourteenth in the morning? I'm sorry. I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then. What about the next day?,0,No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon?,0
696,"Hi Jackie. You don't look too well. What's going on? It's nothing. I'm just a little stressed out. Why? What's stressing you out? School. Since I was working part time, I had a difficult time keeping up with class. Now that we have exams coming up, I'm totally freaking out.",3,The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright.,0
697,"The new webpage design is much more effective than before. I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format. Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page? I thought the old page wasn't half bad... The old page was okay, alright, but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume, because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect. Now it's different. We got our marketing department team in on the action, and the results are smashing... What changes were made from the old page to the new page?",0,"First, the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information. They can sign up for a free monthly drawing. Once we've got their info, it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting. Also, there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services, so as to give confidence to new customers. We also added a specific area for on-line customer service... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback...",0
698,"Pardon me. Could you please pass me the tissue? Sure, here you are. Thanks, I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy. Are you ok? Yeah, I think the food is alright, it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, you should have known better.",0,"Well, not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies.",0
699,"Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy. Yeah, you can increase you tolerance for spicy food, but so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes. I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, but when you have no other choices, you've got to adapt. Yeah, I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome, do as the Romans do. '",4,Exactly.,0
700,"Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted? Yes, at first I felt very awkward. After Bill was demoted and then resigned, it was kind of like somebody died! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something. And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to... Did they mutiny? Thankful, no. I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career. I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor. After a couple weeks, it was like nothing happened.",0,It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them.,0
701,"Are you feeling better today, Bill? Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit.",0,But you should make up your mind first.,0
702,"Hi, John, how was your vacation? Awesome, we went to Australia and New Zealand. That must have been wonderful. Do anything interesting? Well, we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia.",4,Wow! Isn’ t that dangerous?,0
703,"A little, but the rush was worth it. Tell me about it. We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us. 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.",6,"Yeah, It was scary, but exhilarating.",4
704,"Hi, Tina, it's Joe. Hi, Joe. What's the weather like there today? It's really cold. It snowed all day and the school closed early.",0,What's the temperature?,0
705,It's 20 degrees below zero now. It was even colder this morning. Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow. I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.,0,Me too. How's the weather where you are?,0
706,"Mom, I just finished my paper. Can you proofread it before I hand it in? Sure, let’ s take a look. Sweetie, this is terrific. Your ideas are so original. Thanks. I can tell you worked hard on it.",4,I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago.,4
707,"Merry Christmas! Huh? I said Merry Christmas! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here? It is? Oh, that's nice.",0,Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?,0
708,"Actually, I'd forgotten about it. Forgotten about it? How could you? Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.",0,It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.,0
709,"Bill, Happy Halloween! Happy Halloween! What creature are you going to dress up as? I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs. May I have a look at your costume?",0,Sure. Wait a moment. ( Several minutes later ) Here you are.,0
710,"Hey, Karen. Look like you got some sun this weekend. Yeah? I guess so. I spent the weekend at beach. That’ s great. Where did you stay? Some friends of my parents live out there, and they invited me there.",4,"So, what did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, obviously.",4
711,"I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down. Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming? I wanted to, but the water is too cold, and I just wetted in up to my knees. It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.",4,It looks like you could use it. Don’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.,4
712,"OK class, so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class, today we will review everything we have learned. Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is? The brain! That's right, the brain! It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition. Then what major organ is in our chest? The heart!",0,"Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food?",0
713,"The stomach and intestines! Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything? Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder! Oh yes, you are right. Very important organs indeed.",0,"So what do these organs do, teacher?",0
714,Linda? Is that you? I haven't seen you in ages! Hi George! It's good to see you! What have you been up to? I just opened up my own business not long ago.,0,Good for you! What are you doing?,0
715,"So, what’ s new in the kitchen? That refrigerator is new, isn’ t it? Yes. I needed a large one. Before, I had a separate refrigerator and freezer, but this has both combined into one. That’ s usual nowadays. You’ Ve added a few shelves too. Yes. You know I’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients.",0,Did you buy new cupboards too?,0
716,"No, I didn’ t. I gave them a really good clean, so they just look new. The worktop was in poor condition, so I had a new one added. I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils. Yes, I have. I need them to help me with these new dished I’ m trying to make. I need a little more practice before I invite guests over. Looking at the spice rack, I’ d say you’ Ve been learning how to make asian food.",0,"Yes. I’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food, so I’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I’ m pretty good at making curries now, but I still need practice at making thai food.",0
717,"How do you like skiing, Pat? I love it. All my life I wanted to learn to ski. Finally I took lessons last year. I suppose skiing is easy for you. No, quite the opposite. I thought I'd never stop falling down. Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better.",0,I see. Do you ski often?,0
718,"Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night. That sounds great. Oh, yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski? Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg",3,Don't be so frightened. It's just a skill.,4
719,"Hi, Dave. This is Zina. Zina? Zina the Snake? I got your e-mail a couple of months back. Yeah? Which one was that?",0,"The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.",0
720,"Hello, my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight. Yes, what can I do for you? I need to cancel that. We have had a last minute change of plans. I see. Would you like me to reschedule you for another night?",0,"OK, we will let you know as early as possible. By the way, will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation?",0
721,"Can I use your laptop for a while? Sure, go ahead. Oh, isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable? Yes, it is. You want go online? there are no wi-fi hotspots around.",0,"Oh my, no internet access is killing me.",0
722,"Can't you wait till you get home? then you can surf the internet using the broadband, wireless connection or whatever you like. No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends. Now I see, you must be suffering from discomgoogolation. What does that mean? there's nothing wrong with me.",0,"Well, the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google '. Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.",0
723,"Sally, I’ m tired of this Western food. I really miss my mother’ s Sichuan cooking. I’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking. But can’ t you try to get used to Western food? I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much. I suppose you’ re right, Lee. Maybe that’ s why so many Westerners are overweight.",0,"It’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy.",0
724,"Have you ever been to Japan? I'm going in the fall. Yeah, I've been there twice. Really? Tell me about it. What's it like? Oh, it's fantastic.",4,Where did you go?,0
725,"On my first trip I went to Tokyo, and on my second trip I visited Kyoto. What did you think of Tokyo? Very big and exciting, but very crowded, too. Yeah. I've seen pictures of the crowds!",4,And the restaurant are excellent... but they're kind of expensive.,0
726,"And how about Kyoto? Kyoto is lovely. It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city. How was the weather? I was in Tokyo in August, and it was really hot and humid. I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny, but there was no humidity.",0,Sounds perfect. I can't wait!,4
727,Can I help you? Yes. I'd like to borrow these books. Just a second. I'll see if I can find them for you. Thanks.,0,Here you are. You must return them within a month.,0
728,"Hi Sam, would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday? Sure, I love curry. Who else is coming? Jane, Susan, Pete and two colleagues of mine from work. I have no plans for Friday, so curry would be great. Which restaurant do you have in mind?",0,Susan suggested the one on Main Street. She says it is very good.,0
729,"Which one is that? You know, the one just on the corner with Oxford Street. There is a large pharmacy next door. Oh yes, I know which one you mean. I have never been there, but I looked at their menu once and it did look good. Okay then. I think we will all meet outside?",4,What time?,4
730,"Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school? No, I was way too busy studying all the time. How about you? Yeah, I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant. What was that like?",0,It was always very busy there.,0
731,"Why is the long face? I'm getting sick of work man. I can't take the political bull in the company any more. Did you just get your review or something? Yeah, but that's not why I am upset. I just found out another guy got a promotion. He doesn't know how to do anything. He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long.",5,That sucks.,0
732,"I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies. Look on the bright side. At least you have a job. Yeah. I shouldn't stress about this anymore. It's not like I can do anything about it. Exactly. Instead, we should have some drinks tonight.",4,How about a cold bottle of beer.,4
733,You're so witty... So why is the face tilted to the right? This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand. So it's not as convenient for left-handed people?,0,"It's better for right-handed people like me. See, I don't even have to move my arm to see the time.",0
734,"Do you offer a course in business management? Yes, we do. How many nights a week is it? It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.",0,And how long does the course last?,0
735,It lasts for 9 months. When does it start? The next beginning class starts on October 25th. What time is the class?,0,From 7 to 9 o'clock.,0
736,"How much does it cost? It costs 125 dollars a month. Yes, that's all right. I want to enroll in the course. Thank you, please fill out this form for us.",0,Do you want me to fill it out now?,0
737,What’ s your schedule like this year? Pretty busy. I have to pick up a lot of credits this year. What’ s your major? I’ m majoring in French literature.,0,"Oh, don’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry? It’ s really difficult. I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long.",0
738,"Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say? Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery? Let’ s see... If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world. If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!",0,My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!,0
739,Something wrong? Yes. My car is having problems. What's wrong? It won't start.,0,Do you want me to take a look?,0
740,"No, thank you. I think I can handle it. Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I will. Thanks. That's sweet of you. No problem.",0,I might need some tools though. Do you know where I can get some?,0
741,Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree? I suppose I do. The climate here is pleasant. They use said it,0,This city is really comfortable to living.,4
742,"It sure is No other city can match it. It's heaven. Well, if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much. Maybe.",0,That's for sure.,0
743,"Alice, your father is amazing. He’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. I know. He doesn’ t like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself! That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent. It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.",0,They see their independence as a kind of character strength.,0
744,"Happy Birthday, Mary! Thank you. Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it. What a lovely dog! How did you know I love this?",4,I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.,4
745,"Maybe you don't believe it, but it was made by my grandmother. Really? It looks so nice. Thank you. Please have a cup of tea. All right.",4,How about some fish?,4
746,"I haven't seen your father in like 5 years. How is he doing? He's not doing too well. Why? What's wrong? About a year ago, he started feeling weak all the time.",0,Is it due to old age or is he sick.,0
747,"Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth. That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life. That's what my father tells me almost everyday. Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.",0,Thanks. I'll let him know.,0
748,"Wedding rings! Oh, no... Aren't they cool? I like the settings. Jen, is there someone you're not telling me about?",0,"No. I just like looking at wedding rings, OK?",0
749,"Hurry up, get in. I’ m in, let’ s go! OK, make a left here... no wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up! Geez! What’ s the rush?",0,"Don’ t worry about it, just drive. Oh, no, the light is about to change... step on it!",0

What’ s your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help! Here, I know a short cut... just go down here, and we’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let’ s go, let’ s go! Watch out for that lady!",0,I’ m going as fast as I can!,0
751,"I've heard so much about Japan. Is it a beautiful country? Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful, but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France, don't you? Yes, I do feel the same way about France. The swift rivers, the fertile valleys, the large cities-its scenery is beautiful. Will you describe the geography of Japan? Well, it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands. France isn't an island, is it?",0,"Oh, no, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent. But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts. Does Japan have good harbors?",0
752,"Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, is it? No, France isn't very mountainous. But it does contain the Pyrenees, a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons. What kind of Climate does Japan have? The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, we don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, doesn't it? Yes, the climate of France rarely has severe winters. In southern France, one can live in comfort the whole year. Is Japan good for farming?",0,"Yes, Japan is good for farming. Rice is the main crop, but Japan is also an industrial center. Fishing is very important, too. Rice isn't grown in France, is it?",0
753,"Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. How come? It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.",5,I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?,4
754,"Diana, in your opinion, which is more important, IQ or EQ? Why are you asking me the strange question, Jerry? I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night. And the question just lined in my mind. Well. I think IQ matters more. But it won't work without EQ.",0,Why? You seem pretty sure about it.,0
755,"Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life. But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it. That's why people's achievement varies greatly. That ' s true, but what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them.",0,"Yes, Jerry, can you share your understanding of EQ?",0
756,"I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives. Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success? Just as Forrest? Yes, his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ.",0,I got it.,0
757,"Come on! It's time to go! Wait a minute! Just hold your horses! What's your hurry, anyway? Well, I've got to stop and get gas in the car, first. That won't take long.",0,"Well, it won't if there no line at the pump.",0
758,"Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I’ m picking the film, because I don’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick. Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything. Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous. and it’ s so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back. I’ m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’ re always so negative.",0,I’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.,0
759,"You see, that’ s what I’ m talking about, I can’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings. Well he’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories. Love stories? More like one-night-stands.",0,"Don’ t criticize Mario or else I’ ll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours ; they’ re no saints.",1
760,"Which language do you speak? Well, I studied French at school, but I’ Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents? Yes, I do. I’ m learning Chinese now on the internet. How do you find studying a language on the internet?",0,"It’ s not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn’ t too good.",0
761,"I bet you find the character difficult to write! Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they’ re easy for me. So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right? Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?",0,"In a way, it’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.",0
762,"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? Sorry, I thought you knew. But you should tell me you were in love with her. Didn't I?",0,You know you didn't.,1
763,"Well, I am telling you now. Yes, but you might have told me before. I didn't think you would be interested. You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?",1,"Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.",0
764,"So, did you go out with Richard? Yeah. We went to a movie last Saturday. We saw Police Partners II. Did you like it? Richard did, but I didn't. Of course, I told him I liked it.",0,Yeah. So did you do anything else?,0
765,"Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation? I think I will continue my studies. Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree. We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market. So you will continue to study for a master's degree? Well, I think so. But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree. If can get a Ph. D. abroad, it will be much easy for me to get a job at home.",0,How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad.,0
766,What a great weekend that was! My feeling's exactly. I really enjoy the beach in the summer. I couldn't agree with you more.,4,We should come here more often.,4
767,"I think Andy's party will be fun. Yeah, I think so. Oh, by the way, I need to ask you something. What's that? Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?",0,"Sure. Oh, that reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?",0
768,"I went to Super Junior's concert last night. It was fantastic. Really? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now. I am also a big fan of theirs. Yes, their new album just came out last week. It is number one on the billboard. I really love their dancing. They are all excellent dancers.",4,"The lyrics of the new song are beautiful, too. Can you sing?",4
769,"I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. If you would like me to, I could help you with that. Wouldn't that take you away from your project? I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.",0,Is there a good time for you to help me?,0
770,"If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready by Friday. How about meeting in my office? That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have. Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.",4,Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!,4
771,"If you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese? Why? Did tom pop the question? Not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parents’ consent. Let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right?",0,You are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I’ m between a rock and a hard place.,0
772,"I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex. Oh, how did you deal with it? I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up. Oh, it’ s a pity. What was the matter?",0,Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.,0
773,"Like what? He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family. Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first. Yes, he said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.",0,So that's why it’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.,0
774,"Hi, Ann. Hi. You look excited. What's happening? I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days. And you're planning to enter?",0,Of course. This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice.,4
775,"Is there a prize? I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio. Do you think you have a chance? A chance? Not just a chance, I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful.",4,But you haven't practised all that much.,0
776,"What day is today? Today is Thursday. What's the date today? Today is May first, 2003.",0,"Oh, today's International Labour Day. Is it our working day?",0
777,Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday? That would be fine. Where are you going? We plan to go to a forest in the suburb. There is a beautiful river there. We can do some fishing. Great.,4,And don't forget your fishing tackle.,4
778,"Daniel, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school now? The same question to you. Well, we shall make it a secret between us. Deal, Where is Gucci?",0,She is the cheer-leader. They are required to put on a performance. Look! Here they come.,0
779,"Oh, look at her. She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA. I want to be like her. Get real. Don't be so pathetic. Hey, young man! I'm your sis. Don't talk to me like that.",0,"Oh, man, look at her, go! She is amazing! She should be my sis.",4
780,"Boy, you've got such a crush on her, haven't you? Yes, I want to be her boyfriend. Just like in the movie. Are you out of your mind? She told me she liked my new haircut. She thought it was cool.",4,"Go ahead, have a try and be a joke.",0
781,You know John? Which John? Mr.Turnbow’ s son? Yes. I’ Ve read news about him in today’ s paper. And he’ s bright and intelligent. I’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam.,0,I wish he could too.,0
782,"Good morning. I want to apply for a library card. Give me 10 yuan, your ID card and a photo of you please. But I hear that the card is free. Yes, it is. But you must pay a deposit for the card.",0,"There will be a refund when I return the card, right?",0
783,"May I invite you for a dance? With pleasure. You dance well. Do you breakdance? Me, what brought that on?",4,There's a story about breakdancing in the paper.,4
784,"What does it say? According to the story, it's some sort of modern dance style. Like disco? Well, breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance.",4,And disco a kind of nightclub.,4
785,Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place? It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. Do you need it for the whole weekend?,0,We will need it for both days.,0
786,"We will need to know who will be driving the van. The van will be driven by Mary and me. It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that? Oh yeah, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom.",0,Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.,0
787,Guess who I saw yesterday? I don't know. Who? Avril Lavigen! the Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?,6,"yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, her poster, a CD...",0
788,"so you're a big fan, eh? not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer, too. and she was in a movie once again, right? yes, though I don't think her acting skills are that great.",0,what was your impression of her when you saw her in person?,0
789,"Can you lend me fifty bucks? What? Again? Why do you keep running out of money? I guess I don't earn enough. No, I think it's how you budget your life, that's the problem.",0,"That's my business, not yours.",0
790,"True enough, until the time comes that you need to take my money. I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important. So how do you survive from pay day to pay day? I don't just survive. I put money away as well. I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, and I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises. I'm not disciplined enough I guess.",0,In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies. I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits.,0
791,"How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved? I think that the public transport system could be made simpler. I never know where the bus routes actually go. The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line. I think we just need to build more roads. Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we’ d have fewer traffic jams. If we built more roads, people would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars.",0,How would you do that?,0
792,"I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, they won’ t use their cars as much. I don’ t know. I think it’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, for example. I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes. The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular.",0,"That’ s a good point. Car owners will probably be against it, but people who use public transport will be in favor of it.",4
793,"You’ re new here, right? Yes, I am. Will this be your first year? No, I transferred here.",0,What school did you come from?,0
794,"I transferred from PCC. Why’ d you transfer here? I wanted to attend this school originally, but my grades out of high school weren’ t good enough. Is PCC a good school?",0,PCC is great!,0
795,"The bridegroom looks a bit nervous. On this occasion, most people do. Oh, they are playing the wedding March. Here they come. She is a beautiful bride.",0,I am so happy for them.,4
796,"Are you crying? Yes, I always cry at weddings. Harris and Anne are perfect for each other. Yes, they are.",0,You and Tom also make a great couple.,0
797,"Jessica is going back to Holland next week. I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift, but I still have no clue. is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with? yeah, that's her. We had a lot of wonderful times together. She is really a special friend, and I want to get her something meaningful. I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier?",0,I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.,0
798,"yeah, that's nice. hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home. a plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs? I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.",0,I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer. You don't want to get her in trouble.,0
799,"Have you got your invitation yet? My invitation? No, I haven't. My invitation to what? The house warming party. Whose house warming party is it?",0,Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house.,0
800,"Oh, they have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately. It's out in the suburbs. Have you seen the house? Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend.",0,Is it nice?,0
801,"Yes, it is. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen. There's also a garden. Well, that does sound nice. Have they moved in yet? They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight. When are they going to have the party?",0,Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow.,0
802,"Have you ever been to Xi’ an? Yes, I’ Ve been there several times on business trips. But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city. I’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won’ t miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place. I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening.",0,Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane?,0
803,"Tomorrow is Sunday. Let's go out and get some fresh air. I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei. Are you interested in going there? why not? I love animals and I love nature. You can see many cows and horses there. lf you are brave enough, you can try horseback riding. it is fun.",4,sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there.,4
804,"Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here. That is true. Some people go camping, some people pick fresh fruit, some people go boating and some people go grass skiing. I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm. Well, now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try.",4,I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first.,4
805,"Yes. we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first? Of course. I will. Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun. It is. However, you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider.",4,No problem. It is always worth trying something new once in your life time.,4
806,how are you doing? I'm ok. I wish I could say the same for my friend. what happened to him? he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving.,0,was it his first offence?,0
807,unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university. what happened to him then? not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500. did they take his license away?,0,"no, they were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now.",0
808,"what do you think will happen to him? well, he'll definitely lose his license, pay a fine, and maybe even spend some time in jail. that doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer? not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, then the state will appoint him with one.",0,my sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him.,0
809,"Well, sir, we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant. Is that so? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie? I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie. Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment?",0,Certainly.What time will you come back?,0
810,"Want to meet for lunch this Saturday? Sorry, I can’ t. I’ m busy. What are you doing? I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month.",0,What kind of volunteer work?,0
811,"Tom, is Jenny crying? Can you take he away from me? I’ m just coming for that. She kept on bothering me.",0,She’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can’ t you be good to her?,1
812,You’ re making my blood boil. Calm down. Madam. I'm about to explode! You’ Ve made a mess of this matter. I am very sorry to hear that you’ Ve been having so many problems.,0,Sorry isn’ t good enough! What can you do to help me?,1
813,"Can you tell me something about financial aid? What exactly? How to apply for it? In your first letter, that is, when you apply for admission, you should also tell them you need their financial aid.",0,Then...,0
814,How was Mei’ s party on Saturday? Oh I didn’ t go. I stayed at home with my family. Oh really? What did you do? We watched lots of television and films.,0,I see. Anything else?,0
815,What's the temperature today? It's about 5 degrees centigrade. What's the weather forecast for tomorrow? The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow.,0,Are you used to the climate here?,0
816,"I think I'll soon get used to it. What is the average temperature of Beijing? lt's about 180C, but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero. And we have a long winter. Which season do you like best?",0,I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice.,0

We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about. And you think I fit the qualifications?",0,Yes.

820,"How is the college search going? It's a huge headache. I have no idea what I want to do. But don't you want to study music? Shouldn't it be easy? It should be, but there are too many options.

You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, a big school or a small school, a public or private school...",0
821,"I’ m trying to decide what school to apply for. Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? I’ m not sure. What’ s the difference between them? Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.",0,Which is better?,0
822,"Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class. Is this something that you could schedule for another time? No, I have to do this ; it's important! Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?",0,I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.,0

825,"The air quality in this city is horrendous. The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again! Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment. On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city. As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.",0,"I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse effect.",0
826,"What is the greenhouse effect exactly? It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. I see, so it's similar to global warming? They're related to one another, yes.",0,I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.,0
827,"Mary, be calm. It is impossible. You cheated on me. No, listen to me. I always regard you as my best friend. I admire you, and of course you've helped me so much. I should thank you. Shut up!",1,"No, listen to me. Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well. Maybe in other people's eyes, I want you to be my girl-friend. but... but...",0
828,"Our maths teacher is rather humorous. On the contrary, I think he's very serious. No, not at all.His examples are really interesting. So they're easy to remember.",0,"Yeah, how about your maths teacher?",0
829,"He's an old antique, very serious. Bad luck, Anne. Hey! How about your history teacher? She's another antique.",0,I'm sorry to hear that.,0
830,"Hey, if you're not busy this weekend, would you like to go see a movie? Sounds good. What should we see? How about that European movie? You mean the one starring John Travolta?",4,"Yeah, that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding.",4
831,Could you do me a favor? What is it? Could you possibly give me a lift home? All right.,4,Are you sure? I don't want to inconvenience you.,4
832,"I have an appointment for half past one. What can I help you with? Well, I have a problem with my class schedule. What is it?",0,It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time.,0
833,"I can understand the problem with that. Is there any way that you can fix my schedule? No problem, do you want those classes still? Yes, I do.",0,Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day.,0
834,Are there any interesting articles in today’ s newspapers? The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states. Few other stories made the front pages. Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections? There’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs. We have a subsidiary company l,4,Are the reports favorable?,0
835,"Generally, the reporters take positive lines. They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of, but there’ s nothing worrying in the reports. In the classifieds, one of our competitors is a That’ s interesting. They must be thinking of moving into that market. Are there any interesting editorials? Not really. They all seem to focus on the election. There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week. I’ m not surprised. That article certainly added fuel to the debate. Ok. Thanks. Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me? I’ d like to read them.",4,Sure. There you are.,0
836,"He followed me all the way home! That's about five blocks. And around corners too.So he was definitely following you. Yes, he was. I'm not imagining it.Finally, just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious.What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police? Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again, then maybe you should call.",0,Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!,3
837,What's your favorite book? It's Gone With the Wind. Why do you like it best? I enjoy the various characters and the plot.,4,Well. I like the Thorn Birds best.,4
838,"Is it very interesting? Sure. I like the writer's language, too. If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book. Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?",4,That's a good idea. Let's go!,4
839,"May I help you? I would like to check out these books. May I see your library card, please? Yes. Here you go.",0,"Apparently, you have unpaid late fees.",0
840,I do? You owe some money. Exactly how much do I owe? You owe $ 24.50.,0,I won’ t be able to pay that right now.,0
841,"How did you choose courses when you were abroad? That's a very good question. Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal. In order to do these wisely and effectively, you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor. Wait a minute. There are some new terms for me. I can hardly follow you. Ok, I will go into more detail. A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation. You can discuss with him the program selection, changing or adding a program, the requirements for graduation, and other problems related to your study. You will choose some courses, and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation.",0,Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there.,0
842,"So it is hard to be a black student on campus? Yes, in many ways it is. There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life. Stereotypes? Like what? Well, like since I'm black, I must like rap music, come from the inner city, or play basketball well.",0,"I do know you like rap music, but the other two are definitely false. I’ Ve seen you play basketball.",0
843,"Hey! But that's not the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma. You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota? That's not true at all, you're really a smart guy. I know that, but some people don't think like that. And I get problems from teachers as well. Teachers? I didn't think that they would be racist at all.",6,"Racist? Not exactly. It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic, as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject. Suddenly I become the representative of the black race, as if we all had the same opinion.",0
844,Could you help me? What do you need? I can't seem to find my class. What building is it in?,0,It's in the C building.,0
845,"Oh, I know exactly where that is. Do you think you can tell me where it is? Sure, what room number is it? It's room number 261.",0,I have a class around there right now.,0
846,"John, have you ever watched Beijing Opera? Yes, I watched once. What do you think of it? Well, honestly speaking, I went to watch it out of curiosity. I'd say it's really a special art form.",0,"I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.",4
847,"Let’ s play a game! OK! How about Scrabble? No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I’ m going to describe someone’ s face, and you guess who it is! OK!",0,"Let’ s see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!",0
848,"Hi Julie, how are things going? Everything is great, Tad. How are you? I'm doing really well. Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?",0,"Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?",0
849,"That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee. I thought that he was with Malia. Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday. I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!",4,"Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.",0
850,"So, Emily, how was your day? I don't think you really want to hear about it. It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it. To be honest, it was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck!",1,Why? What happened?,0
851,"Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! That's not very fair. What did you do? There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired for me for sure. Does he treat everyone in your department like this?",0,"He treats everyone pretty poorly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake!",1
852,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company? Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.,0,That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders.,0
853,Can you speak English? Yes I can. I speak it very well. Where did you learn it? I lived in England when I was a child.,0,What else can you speak?,0
854,"Hi, Maggy, Did you hear about David? About David, No, I didn’ t hear anything. You know, about David and new boss. Sorry, I don’ t quite follow you.",0,"Well, I hear David have been fired.",0
855,"I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it. How much is it for each square meter? How large is the apartment? It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters. That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment?",0,"Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once.",0
856,I really like the record you lent me the other day. I'm glad you like it. And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long. Not at all.,1,I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it.,1

858,"Yes, about 46 square metres. Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch? Yes. Very beautiful and very interesting. But why do you hang them in the tree?",4,"They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, so they hung them in the tree. Then in winter, they can peel corn ears in their leisure time.",0
859,"So, where are you going to spend your winter vacation? Oh, I’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand. You have a girlfriend in Thailand? Interesting. How come I have never heard of that? Actually it will be my first time to meet her.",0,"You mean you haven’ t seen her before? Then, how could she be your girlfriend? Maybe you don’ t even know her.",0
860,"Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is today! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there! What a perfect day to be at the beach! The kids are going to have so much fun! And we’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they’ re playing. It does seem like the perfect day! I’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather! This looks like the perfect spot! Ok kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp. Here, Mary, help me lay down these beach towels. There we go. Can you help me with the umbrella? Perfect. Ok kids, here’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel. I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don’ t stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.",4,And stay in the shallow area. I don’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It’ s too deep out there and we didn’ t bring your floatier.,4
861,"Hello Hi Angela, it's Dan. Hi B. How are you? Good.",0,I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?,0
862,"Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off. No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, right? Oh, is that next week? Yes. Did you forget?",0,"No, of course not. I already bought them a present.",0
863,"That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, can you tell her for me. Sure. Does she know your friend?

I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get Megan.",0
864,"Hey, look at the offer I got in my e-mail. It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home! Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy? What do you mean? I mean that you're gullible. You shouldn't believe everything you read, especially on the Internet.",0,But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money.,0
865,"Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before? Pyramid scheme? What is that? It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy, like a pyramid. The person at the top asks the people below him for money, and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him. Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him.",4,"Not exactly. The scam keeps on going, with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom.",0
866,"We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning. What do you say we take a break and listen to some music, okay? Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop, too. Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine. While you're picking out a record to play, I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator. You sure have a lot of discs here.",0,"Yeah, I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff.",0

869,"What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot. Yes, that would work out better. You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone. Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.",4,"Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!",4
870,How may I help you? I need to check these books out. Do you have your library card? Here it is.,0,It appears that you have late fees.,0

872,"Merry Christmas! Huh? I said Merry Christmas! Don’ t you know that Christmas is almost here? It is? Oh, that’ s nice.",6,Huh? Didn’ t you know? Aren’ t you excited?,6
873,"Actually, I’ d forgotten about it. Forgotten about it? How could you? Because I’ m not Christian, I’ m Jewish. Oh, I’ m sorry. I didn’ t know.",0,It’ s all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I’ m Christian.,0
874,"Welcome, young man. No offence, but I haven't seen you here before. Of course, this is my first time here. My Mom has a membership here. Here is the card. Okay then. You are the younger customer here ever. It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market.",0,"It's the marketing's fault, I suppose.What do you want to do?",0
875,"Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do? That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, you gotta grow up. I am still young. And I'm growing every minute. Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope.",0,I love running. Anything else?,0
876,I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members. Really? Can I join it? Of course you can if you like it. How can I join it?,0,There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday. You can apply for it then.,0
877,"What do you do in summer? I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? I don’ t often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. What do you do in winter?",0,"Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I’ m feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.",0

881,Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most? I think housing is a big problem. There are thousands of homeless people on the streets. How would you solve the problem? I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.,0,It would probably be very expensive.,0
882,"I think the government can afford it. Besides, there are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i It’ s not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly. If we are to invest more money to education, we will need to raise taxes. That wouldn’ t be popular with voters. Most voters what everything both ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, but without increasing taxes.",0,The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.,0
883,"Would you like to see our new shirts? Sorry, but I’ m not really that interested in those things. Well, they are very nice you know. Really?",0,And not expensive either.,0

885,"Come in, come in! Hi, Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn’ t you meet me there? I thought we were supposed to meet HERE.

We must have misunderstood each other.,0
886,"how was school today, Dominic? I hate school! why? What happened? I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today!",2,it's just one exam. Can you re-take the exam?,0
887,"yes, but it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed! why didn't you do a good job? I don't know. I sat down in my seat, looked at my paper, and then my mind just went totally blank. do you think you studied enough for the exam?",0,no...,0

890,"What? Not my Dad, I hope!? Come on, Mary, it's your brother, Jack. No kidding! Jack is such a log! He's never dated a girl. The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him.",0,And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls. He's putting his heart into his stamp collection.,0
891,"How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth? At least, it is better than my boxed lunch at work. I'm so fed up with the bland food. Thank you for having lunch with me! Any time. But I don't mind eating boxed lunch. The food sanitation is really good too. It's hard to believe that you like it. You are so easy to be satisfied.",0,"Hey, it's not that bad. The food is nutritious and it's really convenient. I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff.",0
892,"Eating is important. You are what you eat. It's not only a daily routine. Well, will you just go back to work after lunch? No. I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch. But you didn't eat anything today.",0,"Well, the bill is paid by month. That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant.",0
893,"All right. I'm going to the McDonald's. For what? I thought you didn't like western food. No, I never did. It's for my son. He loves it, and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week. That's really smart. My son Daniel is the same with your son. I just don't get it, why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food.",0,"Me, either. But, it's for sure that the children market is a really big one.",0
894,What can I do for you today? I need to return a book. Can I do anything else for you? I want to check these books out.,0,Is that all?,0

A few people like extreme sports, but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.",0

898,"I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country. Have you heard of motor coaching? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry. No, I've not heard of it. Tell me about it. It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land. Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach.",0,Is it just a bus?,0
899,My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon. Can you tell me something about it? Certainly. It’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year. What happens on the holiday? Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate. Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year.,0,Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday?,0
900,"Rachel has decided to quit smoking. Really? Why? You never guess she is going to have a baby. Oh, it's unbelievable. She is such a chain smoker.",6,"Yes, yes. She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby.",0

Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.",0,"Yeah I know what you mean. That's why this year I am keeping things more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time, or doing some volunteering work.",0
903,"Mike! What's going on, man! Long time no see! Hey, Pat! Yeah, I haven’ t seen you in ages! How is going? Things doing great! It’ s funny running into you like this. Smell well, just last week I ran into Matt as well. Yeah? How’ s he doing?",0,He’ s doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.,0
904,"Hey, Jack, where's your car? I got rid of that clunker. This is my new one. Is that right? It sure beats the old one? Jump in, I'll give you a ride.",0,"Ok. Boy, this looks expensive.",0
905,"Yeah, it costed a bundle alright. Wow, this's sinking a hole. Yeah, this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned. I believe it. Hoo, this car corners like it's on rails.",0,We are on the high way. I'm the * *.,0

910,I’ d love to have my own farm. It would be very hard work. Are you sure? I wouldn’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy.

911,We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? no idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights.

912,"good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free.

The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it, while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period. Look carefully, and tell me if you see the difference now. Yes, they are different! But it's too professional. What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake. Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin?",0,Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins. We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines. We can judge it with naked eyes.,0
914,There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow. It's the fourth one this year. Isn't it horrible. Yes. We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading. It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees.,0,But we need the wood.,0

972,"Cars might be convenient, but they're so bad for the environment. Do you have a car? No. I used to have one though.

996,"I like to read Fortune. Good. Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid, too. Where does a broadcast company get most of their information? I hope it's not just from press releases. A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting, talking to people at the stock exchange, fund managers, analysts, etc.",0,"But sometimes when a flimsy report, or even a rumor gets on television, there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect.",0

They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook. The picture are of things they want. People sign their name by the item they will buy. That’ s clever!

I think it’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home.",0,"So, what did you get them?",0
1264,"I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems. What’ s wrong with it?

I think you'd like it. it sounds interesting, but I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth. I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, with hilarious results. really? that's interesting!",6,"yeah.Oh, here it comes! why don't we watch it together? they are going to have a court debate in this episode.

Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc. Well, that seems easy enough. Wait, there’ s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has!

Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO. Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot. He actually is the CEO now, or will be, as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with. Yikes! you are joking, right? I can't believe it. No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately.

1360,"So, what's the problem? We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend. You know, after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed.

I find them to be either boring ot useless. I mean, how much can you really learn in one afternoon? It's not just about the things that you learn, you know... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation. You can learn a few things, but more importantly, you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future. The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway. I'm still not too jazzed about going... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations.",0,"Well, what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii? Does that perk your interest?",0

1383,"You should have seen the T. V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting, animal rights. Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights. Yes, but we can’ t deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

If so much attention weren’ t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.",0,"You can’ t compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can’ t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.",0

And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile.",4,You seem excited about it.,0
1386,"Well, you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team. Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there. Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first. But if we develop a good advertising campaign, I think we can break into the market.

That’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They’ re not very fast, but that’ s ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape. Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.",0,I’ d be afraid to jump from that height!,0
1389,"How many people are there in your family? Five. Besides my parents and me, there are my brother and sister. That is a big family. How old is your sister? 15.",0,What about your brother?,0

1454,"Mum, I have something for you today. What for? Don't you remember? Today is March 8th. It's Women's Day. Oh. I've really forgotten it.",6,"Now, close your eyes. ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand. )",4
1455,"Hello, Rebecca, fancy meeting you here! Hi, Paul. I haven't seen you for a long time. How have you been? Fine, thank you, and you?",4,Pretty good. What brings you here?,0
1456,"What courses are you going to take next year? Well, I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics, but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet. I'd like to take English. Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics? Because I want to study english literature. but I think chemistry is better for getting a job.",0,Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated?,0

1462,"What's that, a new video game? Nope! It's the latest generation of PAD! You won't believe what it can do. For instance? It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills.

1464,"I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in person. But, you work with her everyday. That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongue-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red. You've dated a lot. What's so different about Diana?",0,"Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong. Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh... forget it. This was a bad idea.",4
1465,"Well, I guess you don't want this note, then. What note? I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night.

1466,"So, what happened? He never came. He stood you up. I wouldn’ t exactly characterize it in that way. I think something happened. Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to... what if he showed up, took one look at me and left?",5,Not possible.,0

What should I do if he doesn't call me?",0

1475,"OK, that’ s fine. Bye. What happened? That’ s it, my lease is up. I have to move. What? Why? Can’ t you renew it?",6,The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot,0
1476,"Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP. I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while. Well, let me know if there’ s anything I can do to help out. Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?",0,Hehe.. sure,0
1477,Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most? I think housing is a big problem. There are thousands of homeless people on the streets. How would you solve the problem? I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.,0,It would probably be very expensive.,0
1478,"I think the government can afford it. Besides, there are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement. It’ s not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly. If we are to invest more money to education, we will need to raise taxes. That wouldn’ t be popular with voters. Most voters what everything bout ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, but without increasing taxes.",0,The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.,0
1479,"Hello, Joanna. You are looking very charming in the new dress. Thanks. Does it suit me? Yes, it suits you very well. It certainly is unique. I don’ t think I’ Ve seen anything like it before.

The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?,4
1481,"That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them? Sure. What's this one a picture of? Oh, that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city. You don't look very happy in that picture.",0,"No, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces!",0
1482,"So what did you do? We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel. My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre? Of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though.",4,That's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day.,4

Well, you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan.",0,It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.,0
1486,"How many credits are you taking this semester? I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant. But so far, I only have fifteen. What's the matter, are the classes you want full? Yes. And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major.",0,"If you were to take on a double major, what would be your first choice?",0
1487,What part did you get in the play this time? I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes. I wish I had a character part. Those are my favorite. Are you kidding? You got the leading role.,6,"I know, but I've done that so Ay times. It's getting old. The leading guy is always the same macho A.",0
1488,"Great party, isn't it? Yeah, really, jane and ted always have great parties. This is my first, I only met jane last week. she and I teach at the same school. Oh, so you're a teacher.",0,"Yeah, history, what about you?",0

1494,"Dan, Dan, dude. You have to come over to my house right now! Is everything OK? Just get over here! Come in! Quickly!",3,"So, since when is your house a bank?",0
1495,"What do you mean? I mean, what’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows. Security, Dan, security! You can never be too safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window. What’ s the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?",0,"Paranoid?

This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages. It is about a happy family without sex, violence or bad language. I know that. I have seen the film as the same title. Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess.",0,"Yes, you are right. I like the song in the movie, edelweiss, do you remember it?",4
1501,"Of course, it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant. Those young actors play the roles perfectly. I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie. Have you bought the tickets? No, I am asking you whether you will go to see it.",4,Let's go. We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant.,4

1527,"Now that you'recommending such enormous fees, producers, directors, movie-makers must see you in a completely different light. Yeah. Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed. Well, if that's the case, I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have. I can only do what I know, and live how I've lived all my life, because I'm a fairly stubborn person.",0,It seems to me that now you're famous. You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties.,0

I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen. Then fans don't see you much in public places. Yes. I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life. I love what I do and I love how I spend my time, which isn't in a public place. A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts.

1534,"What? You don’ t love me? Me, either. You don’ t love me? No. But we’ re so right for each other.",0,"I know, I know. Well, is there some, is there someone else? Oh, that woman on television, Sydney Ann.",0
1535,"Is this your umbrella, miss? Oh, yes, it is. Thank you. I was looking for it just now. You look a bit familiar to me. I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before. Have you?",0,May I ask where you live?,0
1536,"Just two blocks away, in that tall building. That’ s it. I live there, too. I live on the sixth floor. My family move in just two weeks ago. We live on the fourth floor. It’ s a small world! May I know your name, miss?",4,I’ m Chen Ming.,0
1537,I have a sweet tooth. I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals. A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week. They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people. That sounds really attractive. Let's go to that candy shop now. Are you serious? It is always crowded with many people.,6,"why not? I would like to buy some candies. Since there are so many people, I think they must have delicious candy.",4
1538,"Look at the candy bar over there. It is so colorful and tasty. They have lollypops, chocolate drops, fruit candy, mints, pearbrittles and toffee. They are in different colors and flavors. I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything. Me too. I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people.",4,"To be honest, I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat. I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not.",4
1539,Good morning miss. Wang Good morning Mr. Li It’ s a beautiful morning isn’ t it? Oh. It’ s a nice day indeed,0,"I hope it won’ t be too hot, I can’ t stand the heat",0
1540,"What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school? I’ d say, think twice about it. Well, you are not going to quit school, are you? I don't know. I failed my exam. What did you get?",0,A B plus.,0
1541,"That's not bad. But I should have aced it. I mean I finished the paper so quickly, thinking it's a piece of cake. But when I knew my result, I was like what? That can't be true! Listen, John. I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress, but you really want to give up? No, I don't. I just don't know how to handle this. This is my first time, you know.",5,I know. Don't worry. Do you know what you should do?,0
1542,What? You need to blow off some steam. The world is not on your shoulder. How? Forget about school and exams. Come over to my house and have fun. I have some really good DVDs.,0,Thanks. But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight. I have to get an early start in the morning.,0
1543,"You are too picky. No, I'm not.Hey, look at that guy over there. Which guy? The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window.",0,I can't see him. Where?,0
1544,"Right there. Oh, I see him now. Wait! That's... Yes, it's Mel Gibson. Oh, wow! It's really him! Who is that woman he's with?",6,I don't know. Why don't you go ask for his autograph?,0
1545,"Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time? We have so Ay! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve. What is it? Well, all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids.",0,That's it? That's the tradition?,0
1546,"Karen, do you have a minute? I'd like to ask you about something. Sure. What is it? I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer, and I just want to know what you think. I'm glad to help you. But what is it you want to ask about?",5,I am worried about the meeting this morning.,0
1547,Why? I think the meeting went well. Really? Yes. But what are you worried about? I'm afraid I was too rude.,0,"Rude? You weren't rude at all, Annie. Why do you think you were rude?",0
1548,"Well, I maybe talked to Mr. Drummond too directly. I thought I maybe said too much. I don't want him to be angry. I understand. But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought. I think he appreciates that. Really? Yes.",0,"But I am new here, and I'm not sure he is used to that.",0
1549,"You mean because you are a woman? Yes. And he is the president of the company. Listen, Annie. You shouldn't worry about Mr. Drummond.He is a very good man to work for. He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women. I am very happy to hear that, Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company.",4,"I agree with you on that, Annie. I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now. I feel he appreciates his employees for their work, not their gender. I would never change jobs.",0
1550,"I really admire you, Diana. why, Jerry? Your words just came out of the blue. you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school. I work very hard and that's it, you know, practice makes perfect.",0,isn't there anything else?,0
1551,"I have no idea. you must have a high IQ score. well, Jerry, let me tell you a secret. go ahead.",0,my IQ score is slightly above average.,0
1552,"seriously? But you are such a genius. maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure. well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ. you can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks.",0,"oh, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming?",0
1553,Hey Sarah. Why are you limping? Oh. Hi Matt. I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches. Was it your first time? Yeah. And I never want to go again.,5,"I remember the first time I went. My back was sore, I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt, and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast.",0
1554,That's exactly how I feel now. It's only like that the first couple of times. Ha. There won't be a next time. You gotta give it a chance. It's fun after awhile.,0,"I'll think about it after I start feeling better. Right now, I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding.",0
1555,"Hi Mark. Oh, hi Stacy. How was your summer vacation? I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money, right? What did you do?",0,I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.,0
1556,"So are you officially a junior now? Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same. That makes sense. So where is Nicole? She dropped out of school completely.",0,Really? Why?,6
1557,"She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time. Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job. It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer. Do you know how much they are paying her?",0,"I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn't have accepted it.",0
1558,"Are you a smoker? Yes, I’ m afraid I am. My husband is a smoker too. Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker? No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.",0,When did you begin to smoke?,0
1559,"Jenny, you look terrible. What's eating you? Don't brother me! Hey, chill out, I'm just trying to help. Sorry, Sally, it's not your fault.",5,"So, what's the problem?",0
1560,"I drew a blank on the algebra test. No kidding! Didn't you study for it? Yeah, but nothing was clear during the test. That's too bad, anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next semester.",0,I'm thinking of dropping out.,5
1561,"Lisa, I'm home. How was your day? Pretty good. I've made a few friends already. Anybody I know?",0,"Well, Pam Franklin lives next door to us. By the way, can I go to her house this Saturday?",0
1562,"It's nice and bright today, isn't it? Yeah. The autumn is marvelous here. How about winter? That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, and the road is often icy.",0,"It's boring, right?",0
1563,Sure. Do you get much rain during the summer? Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area. So you should bring an umbrella often.,0,That's right.,0
1564,"Thank you for coming to see me off. Not at all. If have time, I'll come again. You're welcome at any time.",4,Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.,4
1565,"May I invite you to dance with me? Sorry, I can't dance. Never mind, I can teach you. Is it difficult to learn?",0,"No, it is easy.",0
1566,"How should I do? You just follow me. All right. By the way, do you often dance? Yup, because dance can relax myself.",4,It seems a good way.,4
1567,"Hmm, what should I wear today? Come on, you think about what to wear almost every day. There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe. Well, haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe? I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you.",0,"Loving to look beautiful is women's nature. In fact, I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today.",0
1568,"What do you think of the way people use and treat animals? I think most people treat animals well, but we are often cruel to animals. When we raise animals for food, the conditions they live in are often poor. Perhaps people should stop eating animals. We could grow more crops. What would you do with all the animals? You couldn’ t just let them go. Besides, some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.",0,We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.,0
1569,"That’ s true. I think zoo are a good idea, because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it’ s good for kids to see wild animals. I agree. I’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don’ t like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways. I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced. That’ s good news. The good thing is that most people treat their pets well.",4,"Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals, but those stories are rare.",0
1570,"Do you object to drinking black tea, Mr.Zhang? Yes, that is why I never drink it. Do you drink green tea, then? Very seldom, because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health.",0,"But if the tea is good and well prepared, it will do much good.",0
1571,"What good is it for? Not only can it appease one's thirst, but it can also refresh one when tired. That's true, but it must not be allowed to stand long. Why is it so?",0,"Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before, it will do you harm.",0
1572,"Jennifer, would you like to have dinner with me? Yes. That would be nice. When do you want to go? Is today OK? Sorry, I can't go today.",0,How about tomorrow night?,0
1573,Ok. What time? Is 9:00 PM all right? I think that's too late. Is 6:00 PM OK?,0,"Yes, that's good. Where would you like to go?",4
1574,"Hi, long time no see. How have you been? Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some trouble with my son. Tell me all about it. Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's become quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd.",5,"Oh, I see. What makes you think that?",0
1575,"Well, he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band. And one night last weekend, he came home really late, way past his curfew. Really? What happened? He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home. I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?",0,I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.,0
1576,"Hello, Tom! Do you have plans for this evening? Nothing special. How about having dinner with me? That's great. I would love to. And when?",4,"Let’ s fix it at seven o'clock, OK?",4
1577,"Hello Mei, How about going for a meal this evening? Good idea! I finish work at five. Why don’ t we meet at six? Ok that sounds good. Where shall I meet you? Let’ s meet in front of the train station.",4,"Ok great, I’ ll see you at six.",4
1578,"I'd like to meet you again sometime. That would be great. Actually, can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime. Anytime. You can reach me at 5558929. Ok, got it. I will call you sometime next week.",4,Fine.,4
1579,"Lisa, I'm so glad to see you. How are you doing? Fine. I miss you so much, uncle Benjamin. Me too. We haven't seen each other for years. It's been 3 years now.",0,How time flies! Now you are a college student out of a little girl.,0
1580,"Hey, That's a really nice outfit you have on. Why, thank you. I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not. I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said. Oh, you look stunning. Your dress really goes well with your shoes. I'm glad that you think so. I thought it might be a bit too revealing.",4,"No, not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?",4
1581,"I got it on sale down at the department store. When did you go there? I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, you should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale. I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?",0,Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.,0
1582,"I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection. That's a good idea. Some of your ties are pretty outdated. Well, I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made, so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties. Anyways, are you going to the party tonight?",0,"Yes, I am. Say, are you going to wear that outfit to the party?",0
1583,I don't think so. It is a little too formal. I'm probably going to wear something more laid back. Me too. I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans. I guess that you will really be dressing down. That's my style when I'm not in the office.,0,Good point. I suppose that we all have our own individual styles.,4
1584,"Hello, John. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. And you? Very well, thanks. Nice to see you again. I haven't seen you for a long time. What have you been doing lately? Oh, nothing much really. And how is everything with you?",0,"Fine, thanks. I've been busy lately.",4
1585,What have you been doing? I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month. Really? Good luck for them. Thanks. And how are your parents?,4,"They're both very well, thanks.",4
1586,Where are you going now? I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me? I can't. I have to meet someone. It's been nice talking to you.,4,Good-bye. See you again sometime.,4
1587,"What's the date today Mr.Brown? I don't have a calendar. Today is Tuesday, 25th September, 2001. 25th Sep? Oh, I have an appointment tonight. What time is your appointment?",0,It is at 8 o'clock.,0
1588,What time is now? Do you have the correct time? I don't know what time it is. It must be about 6 o'clock. I have to go now. I don't want to be late.,0,You won't be late. It's still early.,0
1589,"Hi, Michelle. Do you need to use the photocopier? Oh, hi Jeremy. No please, go ahead. So how are you, Jeremy? I was talking to Linda about you only last week. Oh, I'm fine, thanks. I'm super busy with work actually. Did you hear about the Lawson contract? No, tell me more.",0,"Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week.",0
1590,What's your favorite kind of music? Do you like pop music? I like almost all kinds of music. But I like country music best. There was a concert country music last week. I wish I had been there!,0,"I like it, too. But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music.",4
1591,What can I do for you? I am returning these books. What did you do to this book? I accidentally ripped the cover.,0,You will need to pay for the damage.,0
1592,How much do I need to pay? I’ m going to need $ 5.00. That’ s not too expensive. It isn’ t.,0,Here’ s the $ 5.00.,0
1593,"Hello? Hi, Randy. What are you going to do this weekend? I’ Ve no idea. Nothing really. How about going hunting with me?",4,Wonderful.,4
1594,"How is your business on the Internet, Steven? Don't mention it. I lost a bunch of money on it this year. I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy. I am sorry to hear that. It shows that you should buy companies, not ideas. I changed my strategy around too. I am investing in good companies now.",0,"Yes, I agree with you. I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon.",4
1595,"It's a good idea. But please be careful when you invest this time. Yes, I will. I should learn more from you. After all I am green hand on it. If you have any question, you can ask me. OK. My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now. I am leaving.",4,All right. Let's chat next time. Bye-bye.,4
1596,Where do you have to go. To New York. When do you have to be there. Tomorrow morning.,0,How long do you have to be there?,0
1597,"I’ Ve got a new boss. Oh, what’ s he like? Well, he’ s got dark hair and brown eyes. Yes.",0,And a white sports car.,0
1598,"Now I understand. But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here? You can buy some of these nice butterflies. No, I'm sorry. I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting. What? You feel sorry for the butterflies?",0,"Yes. I think they should just let them fly free, and not try to sell them to foreigners. It is a kind of destruction of nature.",0
1599,"Well, I agree with you. I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains. I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population. Who knows? Hey, I like these jade bears here. How much are they? This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother. What do you think?",0,If you want. Didn't you buy her a small vase already?,0
1600,"Hi, Monica, I got big news. You got a raise? Not really, just take a wild guess. You got promoted?",0,"Well, it is not going to happen so soon, I guess.",0
1601,"You’ re a big fan of Andy Lau, aren’ t you? Yes, I’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD. I adore him. He’ s my idol. How come you don’ t have all of his films on DVD? Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, especially the ones where he only played a bit part.",0,I see. I’ m sure you’ ll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.,0
1602,"Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday. Are you a member of his fan club? I was, but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, so I’ m not a member now. Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?",0,Of course! I bought two copies.,0
1603,"What would you like to have in your breakfast, bread, egg or sandwiches? Bread. And milk or orange juice? Orange juice.",0,"What would you like for lunch, pork, mutton or beef?",0
1604,"I think mutton is best. What kind of drink do you like most, red wine, beer or champagne? I like champagne. And among apples, oranges and bananas, which is your favorite?",0,Banana of course.,0
1605,"The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition. He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned. Really? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent. What did you think of it? I liked it. I didn’ t think his works were masterpieces, but the certainly weren’ t uninspiring, in my opinion. I don’ t think I’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic. He doesn’ t seem to like anything. Which kinds of paintings do you prefer?",0,"I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, don’ t you?",0
1606,"Yes, I do. I like painters who use will rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think? I agree. I prefer oils too. I collect landscapes, but I only have a small collection. You have a small collection of abstract art, don’ t you? Yes. Good artwork is very expensive nowadays. When I was in china, I bought some calligraphy by famous artists. You should come and see it sometime. That would be nice. Can you read the characters?",0,I know what the characters on the paintings mean. I think Chinese characters look very artistic. It’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist’ s character.,0
1607,"Jenny, are you having fun here? Yes, of course. This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines. I’ m glad you’ re enjoying it. Thank you for the invitation.",4,It’ s my pleasure. Would you like another glass of champagne?,4
1608,"Hey, Tom, I want to learn how to play golf. You're really sporty! I want to do everything I can. Do you have clubs?",0,No. Can I rent clubs?,0
1609,There are clubs for beginners. It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times. What kinds of clubs? Like the seven-piece set. It's only $ 120. I'll buy a set. But you have to teach me.,4,Okay.,4
1610,"You are married to a foreigner, aren't you? So what's it like? Well, in the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulties in getting along. The things that are important to me are not important to him. We had a lot of conflicts. Yeah, I know what you mean. The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures. Now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.",4,"Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, then?",4
1611,"How do you do, Mr.Smith? This is Lili. I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday. I enjoyed it very much. You're welcome. I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime. Thank you, Mr.Smith. I'm returning to China today. Today?",4,"Yes. I appreciate all help and in particular, all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here.",4

Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper? Yes. There is. it has several sections, so it’ s quite a read! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning.",0,What section does it have?,0
1613,"You must like negotiating a lot. People are saying, you are a super negotiator. Ha, I am flattered. Actually, when it comes to negotiate, you don’ t need to like it. You just need to understand how it works. I am not good at it by any means. Give me some advice. Well, generally speaking, if you want to change someone’ s mind or understand his position, you have to put yourself in his shoes. Understand his need and the cost for his need. And then you work together to find a solution.",4,Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down.,0
1614,"Hey, Shirley. The party has been wonderful. My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much, and me too. I've said you will enjoy your life here! I surely will. By the way, is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood? Oh, I've forgotten to tell you. The party is held every other week. And every family gives their own performance each time.",4,My children would like that ; they like dancing very much.,4
1615,"That's good! Look! Who is that guy on the stage? Oh, my God! That's my husband, Benjamin. Really?",6,"He likes American Idol very much, and he always imitates the contestant at home. I can't believe he got on the stage himself.",6
1616,"He performs very well. He is so funny! OK, just ignore him. I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community. After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family! OK, that's perfect! By the way, is there any playground in our neighborhood? Yes, there is one behind our building. And you can play tennis there. But if you want to play tennis there, they will change you 30 Yuan per hour.",4,"OK, got it! Thank you so much. You have helped me a lot!",4
1617,"You said you like classical music very much. Then who is your favorite opera star? There are three of them, the Three Tenors. Oh, you mean Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras. Have you been to their live shows? Yeah, it's really a unique experience. It's a solo concert by Pavarotti. He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing.",4,I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song.,4
1618,"Besides, speaking of classical music, we should never forget about the New Year's Concert. Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, or listen to it on the radio. Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show? Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005.",4,"Wow, you are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.",4
1619,"That's for sure. You know, it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever. Who was the conductor at that event? Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, he just celebrated his 75th birthday. So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future.",4,"The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, music is transnational.",4
1620,I really need to find a parking spot. Are you looking for a space on or off campus? Do you know any spaces on campus? You can park in the student parking structure.,0,Where is it located?,0
1621,"You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus. Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left? Last time I checked, it was pretty empty. What time was it when you went up there?",0,That was earlier this morning.,0
1622,"Ok. Let’ s look at our short presentation on China. What do we need to include? We need to talk about the size of the country and its population. Ok. China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion, making it the latest country in the world by population. It says here that most of the people are han Chinese, but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population.",0,We need to say something about the geography and climate of china. Is there any way to divide the country into sections?,0
1623,"We could divide into five parts. There’ s the northeast, which is mild in summer and very cold in winter. Then there is the northwest, which is largely desert. Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate. The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts. One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer. Then, in the south it is hot most of the year. That sounds very general. It is, buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation. We can select cities from each part and give data for each one. One from each part? Lhasa, Urumqi, Harbin, shanghai, and hongkong. The capital city is Beijing, right?",0,"Yes.

1626,"that's true. What about Lisa? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her. Lisa? No way. I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair. You know rumors can't come out from nowhere. well, okay. Then there is still Michael. But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row. It definitely won't be Michael. no, that would be crazy. But then who will it be? Oh dear, it must be me. I should have known it! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing. What should I do? I've got a family t",5,"well, it could be me too. But I am not too worried.

What you need to do is to relax.,0
1649,you're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time? taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress. I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying! you need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn’ t very usually effective.,0,you’ re right.

1662,"It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive! Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky. I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it? Well, my saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?",0,That's easy.

It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office. I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it. He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast. I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California. It comes from the information technology industry.. there isn't such a large division between home and office, so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in. Maybe so, but it seems kind of strange, which the rest of us in white shirts, dark suites, and ties. It's not as bad as that... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers.

He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. I’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey, where many historical figures are buried, like Isaac Newton, the great mathematician and Winston Churchill, the great wartime leader. Nearby, on the banks of the thames, there’ s the statue of Boadicea. She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain. Women have often played an important role in British history.

1690,"Oh, no, it was a kind of pop art. I like it but I couldn't do it that well. Honey, just do it next time. Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia? No, but tell me some. I am interested. Many oil painting exhibitions are there. That is a kind of Museum Exhibition.",0,Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them?,0
1691,"I am sure you will. There are some works, and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors. And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train.

1714,"Well, first of all, it needs a new engine, which is extremely expensive. When's the last time you had it serviced? It must have been a few years ago now. I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.",0,"They do. Once my son was born, there was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, you know!",0

1716,"Can you play baseball with me today? No, I can't. I'm sorry. I have to help my mother. We're going to move tomorrow. Where's the new house? Is it far from here? No, it's not far. It's near our old house.",0,Can I help you pack?,0

I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the black market. Don't tell me you actually believe all that? Don't be so gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you.",0,"Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?",0
1722,Wow! I can’ t believe I’ m standing here! What are you so excited about? I’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art! What’ s the big deal? It’ s just a picture of some woman.,0,"I’ Ve seen it so many times in books, but I never imagined I’ d get to see it in person.",4
1723,"There are tons of other paintings that I think are better. Maybe so, but do you have any idea how much this one is worth? No, how much is it worth? About 80 million dollars.",0,Whoa.,0
1724,When were you Bron may I ask? On 20th May 1963. Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar? 27th day of the fourth month.,0,"By the way, could you tell me when the film will begin?",0

1730,"Well, it depends on the journey. It's.. I guess it's not too expensive, but the minimum price you would pay is, for a short journey, is about a pound. Mm, yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting? Hmm, yeah, well this girl here at the back, that's leaning on the door, um, she looks really bored, actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go!

I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it? well, my saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?",0,that's easy.

I am sorry, sir, there’ s nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big. Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this. Let’ s see... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.",0,That’ s more than my round-trip ticket!,6

We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology, and it's surprising to see the results. What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website? From the numbers, it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines, but from our circular insert. That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format. Based on these findings, I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future!",0,You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?,0

1755,"I told you to wear running shoes. But you don't listen. I thought leather shoes will do just as well. Hold on, don't move, I will take care of that. What are you going to do?",0,"I will get some ice, and put it on your ankle.How does that feel?",0
1756,"So Chris, I've heard that you're from a big family. How many people? Nine total. Seven children and my parents. Seven children? That's a lot. Why did your parents have so many? Well, my mother came from a big family, and wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.",0,"Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.",0
1757,"It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make. Like what? I assume that there's no privacy. That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, from toys to clothes, is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs. And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.",0,Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.,0

What is that?,0
1765,"That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist. It doesn't sound like an English word. It's not. It's an ancient Greek word.

1767,"What are you reading? It’ s an article about language. It talks about the idea of having a single global language. It seems that English already is the main global language. Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language. Actually, it suggest English. The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and japan. So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful. The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language. Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English.",0,Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?,0
1768,"Ahh... What a fine day! I do feel like an outdoor exercise. How about taking a walk in the park? OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh.

1781,"That girl looks very attractive, doesn’ t she? Do you think so? I don’ t like girls who look like that. I like girls who aren’ t too slim. If you like her, go and talk to her. I’ d like to, but there’ s her boyfriend. He’ s very broad-shouldered. He’ s huge! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that.",0,Do you prefer tall girls or short ones?,0
1782,"I don’ t mind, but I like girls with long hair. We have different tastes. I like girls with short hair. I like tall girls - probably because I’ m so tall myself. Have you ever dated a girl taller than you? No, never. I don’ t think I’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me! Have you gained weight recently?",0,"Yes, I have.

Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is.",0,But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth.,0
1792,"May, is the university a terrible place? Surely not. Life in the university is fun. Why did you ask? Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam.

1793,"Of course I know. I once attended Lisa's class, sitting quietly at the back of the classroom. Oh, really? Were you not caught? Of course not. You are allowed to attend any lecture, only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class. In universities, you study in a free and creative environment. What do you want to study in the university? Have you thought about it?",0,"This question has really been bothering me. I like Chinese literature, you know. But economics is really hot now, and it has a very good career prospect.",0
1794,"Who is your favorite NBA star? Kobe Bryant, of course. Kobe? I know him, the key guy of the Lakers, a heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense. He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.",0,Maybe he is not good at rebounding?,0
1795,"Indeed, no man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit.

Yeah, he often scores by free kicks in crucial games. But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks. Certainly not. What really counts is to play as a team, passing the ball amongst each other, dodging defenders. Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.

Miss, I just checked with the kitchen, and they said your order will be coming right up next. Oh, here comes.",5,Thank you.,4
1897,"How do you like this waltz? It's very nice, I like it very much. Well, then, may I invite you for the first dance? My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, and I suppose you dance often.",4,"Me? Oh, no. In fact, I took up dancing quite recently.",6
1898,"Oh, really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well. I'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner. Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader. Do you like the fox-trot and tango? Yes. And what dances do you do best?",4,"Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings, and is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance.",4
1899,"What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend? We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River. How hard is the climb? It is a very difficult climb, because there are not many places to put your hands and feet.",0,What did you do last week?,0
1900,"We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff. It's very exciting. Wow. That sounds like a lot of fun. I am sorry I missed it. Well, you should come this weekend. I think you could do the climb. Yeah, I will. See you then!",4,"Ok, see you.",0

Right, but that's where my heart is. But you're right, now there are only 14 living at home. My goodness! Your family must live in a huge house.",0,"Yes. My family lives in rural Korea, near Pusan. We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon, students come for special tutoring in biology, Englis",0
1903,"Wow! you grew up in a school! No wonder your English is excellent! My aunts and uncles are all teachers. You are so lucky! I guess so. While growing up, I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year.",0,That's what i did in America. I was reading all the time. I was never a big TV watcher. TV wastes time.,0
1904,"... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us in terms sales this month? Uh well... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news? What? Ed, don’ t tell me you only have bad news! Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It’ s a real mess.",0,For crying out loud... How fast are we losing money?,1
1905,"Um... how can I put this? Let’ s just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months. What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what’ s the bad news? Oh, that’ s the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We’ re going to have to shoulder this cost. Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!",6,"We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.",0

1914,"Hi, Jenny. Are still working? Hi, Nancy. Come in please. I'm just putting away on my books. So, you are leaving, aren't you? Yes, I’ m going to take a holiday tomorrow.",0,How nice! I can see you are busying packing. I'm sorry to interrupt you.,4
1915,"That's all right. I'm almost finished. Do you need my help? Yes, could you please go over this for me? And see if there is any mistake in it? Oh. All right I'll read it soon. Excuse me for taking your time.",4,It's nothing Nancy.,4
1916,"Why do you look so gloomy? What are you looking for? My dissertation. I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now. Did you finish typing it yesterday? Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, but it is lost.",5,Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?,0
1917,"Yes, but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk. How about the shelf? I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it? Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.",0,I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?,5
1918,"Where's Bill? The ambassador is already here. The meeting is set to start at 9 am. He's late again. Traffic is probably holding him up. You know, he commutes from the suburbs. It's not easy commuting every day. We should cut him some slack. Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there, I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late. He takes the train, remember? Oh, that's right. Well, the train shouldn't be late. That means there is only one explanation... Bill must have overslept.",0,"Well, to be fare, since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, no telling what time he actually gets up.",0
1919,"What can I do? Take the books out of the bookcase. Put them in this box. Well, the books are in the box. What can I do now? Take the magazines out of the bookcase. Put them in that box.",0,All right.,0
1920,Have we sold out all the newspapers for today? Yes. What a good job we have done! Why are so many extra gifts left here? Many customers didn't want them.,0,How about giving them to that old man?,0
1921,"Good idea. By the way, do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers? I'm not sure, but still it did attract a large crowds today. I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper.",0,But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around.,0
1922,What's your number? I'm number seven. What about you? Five. Hah hah! You have to go before me.,0,You think it's funny. I'm terrified.,3
1923,"Don't worry. It's safe. But I've never jumped off anything in my life. The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed. I'm scared. You are the one who wanted to come here, Sandy.

1925,"Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, this summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent. Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there? Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time. It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Kiang Shan?",0,Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty.,0
1926,"For our lunch meeting with the investors, do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up? Usually for lunch, we don't have to reserve a table, they should allow walk-ins. But to be on the safe side, I'll order a table for half-past twelve. Will that suit your schedule? I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve. Can you make the reservation a little earlier? If we start earlier, it will give us more time for a longer lunch. Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal?",0,"Yes, we'll start with appetizers, follow with a soup and salad course, then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken, and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort.",0
1927,"Hi Jane, can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening? Certainly, where will you be coming from?

Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit.",4,Got that.,4
1928,"Ok - when you leave the Underground, cross the road and you should see Horntown Street. Was up that street to the crossroads. As you was you should see a fast food place on your right. Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Horntown Road. Do I go straight at the intersection? No, you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right.

What can you choose from?,0
1931,"Well, I have to take all the fundamental course, plus a few from my major. What is your major?

1932,"Interesting. That’ s very different from the Chinese education system. Yes, it is. It’ s also very different from the British education system. Really? oh, sure. In British, students don’ t have to take the foundation course.",0,why not?,0
1933,"Hey John, nice skates. Are they new? Yeah, I just got them. I started playing ice hockey in a community league. So, I finally got myself new skates. What position do you play? I’ m a defender.

1941,"You like movies? Yeah, I think it's the best way to relax. What type do you like the best? Really it depends on my mood. When I am sad or depressed, I like comedies. If I'm feeling good, I'll watch almost anything.",0,I see. I generally like movies to help calm me down. I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it.,0
1942,"I can’ t wait to retire. And then what? And then I’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day, every day! That sounds boring to me.",0,What do you plan on doing after you retire?,0

1947,"Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading? This one right here should be right.

1950,"Nice try. I wasn't born yesterday, you know. I'm dead serious. They've decided that it's too small to be a planet, but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore. That sounds crazy. But they can't just change their mind about things like that. Yes, they can. If you remember correctly, people used to believe that the world was flat.",4,"I suppose you're right. They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them, not the other way around.",0
1951,We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos. Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation? I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way. Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space?,0,I hope not. I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth.,4
1952,"You're just left school, haven't you, Emily? Yes, I finished last Friday. You sound relieved. Well, yes. I don't mind admitting that I am.

1953,"Hello, Jack here. Hello, Jack. It's Mary. What are you doing in your office? I am working. I often work late on Thursdays. I am busy this week.

1954,"What about Saturday? Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening. Will you come round next Tuesday? Next Tuesday? Just a moment!

1958,What happened to that girl you were seeing? Oh Jackie? We broke up last week. That was a short relationship. You only started dating 2 months ago. It was actually a long two months. She was a psycho.,0,What do you mean?,0
1959,"She would be laughing one moment, and if I said something insensitive, she would start crying. I didn't want to deal with that. She sounds very emotional. She was a psycho, man. One time we were suppose to get together. I was waiting for her call, and when she finally called, she was screaming why I wasn't at her place. Were you suppose to be there?",0,I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping. It was a misunderstanding. She was literally screaming on the phone over this.,0
1960,"Adam. I’ m sorry. Where have you been, Alice, you're over an hour late. Yes, But I couldn’ t help it. I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus. The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam. It was one thing after another. why ere you getting off work so late? The office close at six, doesn’ t it?",1,Yes. But those are the rush in that moment. And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters.,0
1961,How was the movie last night? I didn't really like it. Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography. I found it very disappointing.,2,"She liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see.",0
1962,Would you like to come to our party? I'd like to. But I'm not myself today. What happened? You look so pale. It's the end of the world for me.,5,What makes you say that?,0
1963,"Today, I'm told I failed three courses. Oh, that's too bad. Work harder next term. B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me. Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine.",0,I hope so.,0
1964,"hey, the new SOHO. How's everything going? everything's great. I've just returned from my office. your office? Aren't you a freelancer? sure I am. I work for myself, but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area.",0,a virtual office?,0
1965,"yeah, an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies. I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building. what kind of services do they offer? a separated office, internet access, phone services, fax services, mail & courier services, and almost everything you have in a conventional office. sounds fun.what else?",0,"I get a business address at an expensive location, and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor.",0
1966,I just love your hair that way. Thanks. Where did you have it done? My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?,4,Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.,4
1967,"That was a great party. Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up. It certainly was a great party. It’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here. I expected that something might get broken. That doesn’ t bother me. That spilled drink won’ t leave a stain, will it? I doubt it, I'll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn’ t a glass of red wine, I’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth.",0,I’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag.,0
1968,"Afterwards, we can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks. Yes, he’ s very good.. isn’ t he? He told some funny stories too. Amanda told some very funny jokes. At the beginning of the party, she was being very serious. I think that she had a litter too much of the punch.",0,"What did you put in that punch? It tasted great, but was quite strong.",0
1969,"Mom, this is your third bowl of rice! I know but I have no choice. My stomach just keeps crying for more and more. Why? I never saw you eat so much before. I've been going to the gym these days. The exercise makes me hungry all the time.",0,So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out.,0
1970,Don't pull my leg. This way you'll probably put on more weight. Will you give up? Surely not. I can feel the results. I'm starting to feel different now. Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight?,0,I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed.,0
1971,"Oh, I've got an idea. Why don't you ask Dad to go with you? He badly needs some exercise. Your father is a bit too timid. He even doesn't know how to introduce himself. He can just say, I'm Benjamin. I'm new and shy. Girl, don't make fun of your Daddy. But I can introduce him to my personal trainer. Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato.",0,Who knows!,0
1972,"Look, Bob. This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia. Let me see it, can I? This is a good photograph. Who are these people? They’ re people I met during the trip. That’ s the ship we traveled on. What a beautiful ship! Who’ s this?",0,That’ s the man I told you about. Remember?,0
1973,Ah yes. The one who offered you a job in Australia. That’ s right. Who’ s this? Guess!,0,"It’ s not you, is it?",0
1974,"Hey, Jack! Is Jenny coming with us? Yes. Why? Nothing. I am just asking. Just asking?! Why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, someone has a crush on Jenny, doesn't he?",0,Who has a crush?,0
1975,"Come on, Ted! Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, you’ Ve got to tell her. Maybe she likes you. Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out. What are you so afraid of? Just tell her what you are feeling about her. I’ d totally die if she turned me down.",0,"But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You’ Ve got to let her know. Come on! You’ Ve got to take a chance. Even though you are rejected, it’ s not the end of the world. There’ s nothing to lose, is there?",0
1976,"Shall I punch out for you, Ross? I am leaving now. No, thanks. I have got to work overtime. But today is Friday. You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening, are you? Well, I am. I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting. Is Tom coming to pick you up?",0,No. We’ ll meet at my house. He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa.,0
1977,"That's nice. Where is his villa? It's not his villa, but his father's. I think it's somewhere in Florida. I am not sure myself. Sometimes I envy you a lot. Tom is a good guy. Come on. You just haven’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much. You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life.",0,"I know, but I am a work maniac.",0
1978,"Well, suit yourself. I've got to run now. Have a nice weekend. You too. Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing. A girl called this afternoon. She said she was your ex-girlfriend. She wanted you to call her back. Did she mention anything else?",0,"No, nothing else. See you Monday.",0
1979,Are we going to have gym class tomorrow? Are you crazy? Tomorrow's Saturday. Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays. Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays.,0,So there are only five working days in a week?,0
1980,"Jacob, are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine? That depends. What does she look like? Well, she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair. How tall is she?",0,"She's fairly tall, maybe 2 inches taller than me.",0
1981,"Is she chubby? Not at all. She's actually very athletic. It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses? No, but she does wear contact lenses.",0,How's her skin?,0
1982,"She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose. Does she have any piercings or tattoos? I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos, one on her lower back, one on her neck, and one on her left foot. What's the tattoo on her foot like?",0,It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one.,0
1983,"Even her mother? Yes, even her mother. What's her personality like? She's a lot like me.",0,So there is something wrong with her! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true!,0
1984,"Good morning, Jason. How did you sleep? Pretty well, thanks. Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit, but last night I got at lease six hours of rest. Great! So, are you ready for a full day of shopping? Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited!",0,I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.,0
1985,"Live chicken? Thanks, but no thanks. So... tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local? Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But... if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price. Cool! Teach me! For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first. You've got to know what things cost.",0,"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else.",0
1986,"I’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn’ t broken! I feel just awful about this whole thing. I wanna make it up to you. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. My treat. That sounds great!

Government service can be a rewarding and secure career.",0,Do you mean financially rewarding?,0
2003,"Well, many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries. I’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy. Sometimes that’ s true, but not usually.

2011,"It’ s so relaxing, taking a walk in the country. The air is so fresh and clean. Would you like to live in the country? I’ m not sure I’ d like it. I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage. What do you mean?",0,"Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The tow just don’ t go together.",0
2012,"I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities. People can’ t have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, buy there’ s more to do. I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They’ re so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings. I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.",0,The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There’ s so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.,4

2022,"Special rules? There, you only have two ways for visiting. Details? On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.",0,Why not?,0
2023,Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be. That makes sense. But that sounds interesting. Is there one in Beijing too? Yes. I prefer to go there next time.,0,"Yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.",0
2024,"What are you doing there with your mobile phone? I'm moblogging! Moblogging? what does that mean? Oh, moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging '.

Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me. What are you talking about? How does it exploit people? Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.",0,"Geez!

2081,"would you recommend going there for a few days? personally, I think it’ d be better to go when you have more time. A few days isn’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital. you’ re probably right. What do you think about Yangshao? it’ s a beautiful city, but I think it’ s become too touristy. How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong?",0,I’ d like to get away from the big city life.,0

2085,"Look! There are playing The Matrix today. You are right, look at the crowd. Do you think we will be able to get tickets? I don't know. If we can't, we can buy from ticket scalpers. No way. I'd rather go to another movie house.",0,"Come on. We are already here. Besides, I really wanna see this picture.",0

Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.",0,Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world?,0
2092,"Which country makes the best coffee in the world? Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee. Brazil exports a lot of coffee. But I love Irish coffee. So it's hard to say. Just depends on your taste. I agree. I heard in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true? Yes. No doubt about that.

2094,"The survey said that the low, income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis. That makes sense. Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper.

The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day!,0

2146,"I have plenty of gas. Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze. So what can we do?

It's also located near the sea, so he can park his boats next to his house. It's absolutely amazing! Would you want to live there?",0,"I think his house is fantastic, but I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, plus a few people to take care of the gardens, and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own.",0
2157,What's your dreamhole like then? My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England. Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself?

2160,I eat more and more these days. And it puts even more weight on me. It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning. What about trying something else? I'd love to do that. What do you recommend? More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days. Do you want to have a try?,0,Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation?,0

There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum, I was hoping you ' d like to come with me. I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day.",5,What about sunday?,0
2167,"I wish I could, but it's my mums birthday. Maybe next week. Much as I ' d like to, I am afraid i wont be free next week, I have a lot of work. Sorry to hear that, I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, I really enjoyed our last chat.",5,"I am really sorry too, maybe I can give you a call sometime.",5
2168,"Hello, Mrs Turnbull. How are you? Fine, thanks. How's your boy, Jack? He's a bit tired. You know, he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four. then he does his homework after tea. It often takes him a couple of hours to finish Poor boy. They work hard at school nowadays, don't they? Does he like it?",0,"School, you mean? Yes, he does. He likes his teachers, and that always makes difference.",0
2169,"Are you an American? Yeah. Why don't you speak English? Oh, my mother is a German, so I can speak German.",0,"Oh, do you like Chinese?",0
2170,"Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, but it is too difficult for me. I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons? Very Good. I'd like to do that. When will we begin?",0,How about tomorrow night?,0
2171,"Lily, do you know Lizzy? Lizzy who? Lizzy smith. Of course I do.",0,"Then, Do you know her younger sister?",0
2172,"You mean Mary? Yes. Sure. I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary. Oh, not bad. Then do you know her mother?",0,"Yes, certainly. I know her mother and father, and brother and sisters, too.",0
2173,"This place serves good breakfasts, don't you think? Yes. But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast. What are you planning to do today? I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach. I want to rent one.",0,Have you done windsurfing before?,0
2174,"No, but it looks fun. I always wanted to try it. Can you take a little advice from a friend? Sure. What? Don't waste your money. Windsurfing is very hard. And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour, and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall.",0,But I always wanted to try it.,0
2175,"I don’ t know what I’ m going to do! It’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job! Don’ t worry. I don't think you’ re going to lose your job over one mistake. It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. But it wasn’ t just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do.",0,"That’ s true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, and there’ s nothing I can do about that. My boss won’ t believe me if I tell him the truth.",0
2176,"Let’ s think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings? I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I’ d rather invest my money somehow. Well, you can't have everything. Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job. When is your contract up on your apartment? Next month. So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year.",0,"Well, that’ s good. If you lose your job, you can just move in with me until you find another job. That will save you plenty of money.",4
2177,"Excuse me, I need your assistance. Sure, what's up? I have no idea where my class is. Tell me which building it's in.",0,My class is in the C building.,0
2178,"I know where the C building is. Do you mind telling me where it is? Of course, which room number is it? Number 261.",0,I actually have a class right around there.,0
2179,I'm more worried about snipers. Snipers? Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price. So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha?,0,I heard about a software program called turbid. It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction.,0
2180,"So, Fred, what are your plans for after graduation? Well, I’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown. That’ s cool. Have you already found an apartment to live in? I’ m planning on living with my parents. Won’ t you?",0,"I couldn’ t even if I wanted to. My parents told me that if I went home, then’ d have to find my own place.",0
2181,"You mean they’ re kicking you out? Not really, they just don’ t want me living at home. My older sister did that, and she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, it got harder and harder for her to move out. Well, it’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it’ s ok if I move back home to begin with, but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so. My parents just didn’ t handle my older sister very well, and because of that, they want me to be more independent. They think that it’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own.",0,"I know I need to learn that myself, but I just don’ t have the money for it at the moment. Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place.",0
2182,"Ok, so who are we going to invite to our dinner party? Well, we have the Thompsons, the Greens, and the Anderson, about twelve people total. Don't forget my friend Andy from the office. He has nothing to do on Friday, so I invited him over. But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!",6,Why can't we?,0
2183,"It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date? I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon. But we can't have thirteen for dinner! I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a superstition. It really doesn't mean anything.",0,Absolutely not! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!,0
2184,"Hello, Alice. Would you like to go to the temple fair with me? Temple fair? Yes. The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth, and they have developed into a festival filled with food, performances and games now. Sounds interesting!",4,"Absolutely, I love temple fairs. Beijing has several temple fairs recently. They are different from each other to some extent, but also have a lot in common.",4
2185,"I just can't wait to see them. Which one do you choose today? What about Tianqiao Temple Fair? A variety of opera performances, acrobatics shows, and food will dazzle you. Great! Do you know how to get there? Of course.",4,Couldn't be better.,4
2186,"Excuse me, Supen. I hope nothing is wrong. Please forgive me, but I have to leave. I feel terrible. but... What's the matter?",0,My daughter isn't feeling well.,0
2187,"Oh, no. Is it serious? I don't know. Will you forgive me? Of course. I'm sorry for your daughter. Thank you. It's our first date. I hope it's not too offensive.",0,Not at all.,0
2188,"Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I hope so. I would like to register for Comp Lit 287. I'm sorry, but that class is already full.And also, students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system. I know. I already tried to register for it by phone, but the computer won't let me.",0,That's because it's full.,0
2189,"But I'm a new student here. I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class. I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office. Well, I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class. What is your name? My name is Karen Huang. That's spelled H - U - A - N - G. Alright. And what is your major?",0,I'm a comparative literature major.,0
2190,"Wait a minute. You're a Comp Lit major? Yes, that's right. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know you were one of our students. That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287. I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it.",0,"The university computer system saves extra places, in class 287 for comp lit students. I can give you a special code.When you register by phone, you can use the code to get into the class.",0
2191,"Even if the class is full? That's right. Oh, I didn't know that. Sure. Here is the code number, with information on how to use it.",0,Thank you. So you think I will be able to get in with this?,4
2192,"Who's that man over there talking to James? Where? Oh, that's Henry. He's very handsome, isn't he? What's he like? He's very nice, actually, but rather eccentric.",0,Really? I love eccentric people.,6
2193,"Yes, but he may be too eccentric even for you. Why? What do you mean by that? Well, haven't you heard? Heard what? No one ever tells me anything.",0,"Well, apparently, he's been having an affair with his secretary.",0
2194,"How did you first meet Jack each other? That is a heavy raining afternoon. I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain. It's getting dark. And then? I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked, ' Where is your home? '",4,Then he sent you to your home?,4
2195,"Where are you from? I'm from Germany. So you speak German, don't you? Yeah, but I can speak English, too.",0,"Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?",0
2196,"What are you reading? Gee! You scared me! Aha, Fitness Consultant. Very good, Don't you know about the rules in this office? Yes, Ma'am. No magazines during the office hours. I'm sorry.",0,"Well, don't do this again next time. What is it about, anyway?",0
2197,"It is about sports for white-collar workers, people like you and me. What kind of sports? Aerobic sports, for example, jogging, yoga, skating... Interesting. What were you reading just now?",0,Stretching exercise after sitting a long time.,0
2198,"I like NBA very much. Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U. S.? No, I didn't. What a pity!",0,Do you like NBA?,0
2199,"Yes, of course. Who do you like best of the NBA players? Kobe. So do I.",0,"Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight, shall we?",4
2200,"Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch? Sure! What kind of food would you like? I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe. I know the perfect place!",4,Good! Where is it?,0
2201,"I'm reading an interesting report on Mars. Oh, what does it say? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars? Absolutely! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface. It's just a matter of how deep it is. Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants?",0,The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.,0
2202,"Actually, we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet? I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, but they have looked at various designs. One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory? Well, I'm not really an expert in this area, but my understanding is that anything is possible. It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago.",0,But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans.,0
2203,"When are we leaving for our field trip? Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a. m. in the morning. Can you mark that on your calendar? Yes, I will write that down. That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, so plan to arrive at 7.",0,"Yes, I will be there on time.",0
2204,"We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up? Yes, someone is coming to get me. The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p. m. and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p. m. What should we bring with us?",0,I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. Check it out when you get a chance. See you Monday!,0

2207,"Oh, my! It's really hot. I've never seen such scorching weather in my life. Tell me about it! It's like the whole world is broiling. Oh, look at the thermometer! The temperature has hit 98. I hope it's not gonna break into three digits",0,But it's already awfully close.,0
2208,"do you want to go out for dinner tonight? sure. Have you got anywhere in mind? I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions. that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?",0,"I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.",0
2209,"if you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, they've westernized their food, so it's not actually that spicy. you're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us. the Taj? They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food.",0,the Taj it is then.,0
2210,shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money? they'll still charge us a corkage fee. that's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway. don't worry about money. I'll treat you tonight.,0,are you sure? We could go Dutch.,0
2211,"Robin, what are you going to do tomorrow? Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning. And later? Well, in the afternoon, after a long nap, we’ ll go yachting with Nora.",0,It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow.,0

2213,"The summers are so great here! Not hot at all. I love the cooling breezes, the clear air, all the greenery. This really has been a wonderful holiday for us. Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while? Let's do both! Are we in a rush or anything No, not really. I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight, but we can't unless we rush it. Let's stay in Bremen instead. Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg, then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there.",0,"Sounds fine to me. Whatever, let's enjoy this pond first.",4
2214,"Hey Jack. What's going on? Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me? Really? When did you decide this? I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.",0,"That's exciting, man.",4
2215,"So how did you propose? You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now. What do you think I should do? There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.",0,I never thought about that.,0
2216,"Thought about what? Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react? I don't know. You should know how she's going to react. She is your girlfriend. I think that's the idea I was looking for. Thanks, man.",4,Don't mention it. Good luck. You're going to need it.,4

2227,These things are always oooo boring. Heard any gossip? Anybody making the big bucks? Rich struck it rich in advertising. And he and Cath got married and just had a child. That's no news. Those two were high school sweethearts anyway. Teresa Jones got a boob job.,0,"Uh, I can see that. And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight.",0

2234,Let’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus. Better take the subway. It’ s faster and more convenient. Okay. It will be a new experience for me. We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway. Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy.,0,where do we pay the fare?,0
2235,Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token. Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in. Let me pay for it. Where can I get the subway Madam? Ask the worker who sells token to give you one. It’ s free of charge.

2241,"Yes. I’ m on a diet, but I’ Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I’ Ve lost twelve pounds. Wow! That’ s great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break. What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I’ m taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday. Dance? You only go dancing? That’ s not hard. I can do that.",0,Sure.

Also it has low cost, and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet, which is very cheap. Yes, going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much. But does it have any disadvantages?",0,"To be frank, sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways.",0
2244,"You mean there may be credit problems? Yes, but if you choose some good B2B websites, such problems can be avoided. Will you give some suggestion? Of course, such as the Alabama, which is a famous website.",0,Thanks. Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future.,4
2245,"Alright everyone settle down. Let’ s get started.As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first? Cinct de mayo? No, that’ s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers’ Day. Do we get a day off from school then?",0,"No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.",0
2246,"Www, man! In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’ s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect. Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now? Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.",0,And then what happened?,0

That's normal for anyone with a newborn.",0,"Yeah, but it's so hard. I have to work, and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby. I'm going to get sick at this rate.",0
2249,"Irene! I heard you were on a date last night! So, how how did it go? I want all the juicy details! Um... well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night. He was... amazing!

2253,"Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem? I don’ t know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is? Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Mmmm, it doesn’ t look good. What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It’ s brand new!",1,"Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.",0
2254,"Do you like climbing? Yes, I like it very much. How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow? Where is it?",4,"It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing, in a park with the same name. There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer, so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain '.",4
2255,"Have you visited it before? Many times. Except climbing, there are many attractions worth visiting. Like what? It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November. During the period, thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area.

2256,"Lester, you are really fantastic at automobile repair. Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I’ m allowed to repair cars for a living. That’ s not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified. I guess I never thought of that before.",4,"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, or from the government.",4
2257,"Hey, Ted. What are you up to this Friday? Well, I have the day off from work. That’ s great! Do you have any plans? Well, I’ Ve been working so hard lately, so I’ ll probably just take it easy.",4,Sounds nice.,4
2258,"Judy, what is everybody talking about? Haven’ t you heard? Richard was fired by our manager. You’ re kidding. It can’ t be true. Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.",0,Really? I’ m surprised.,6
2259,"How do you like waltz? It's very nice, I like it very much. May I invite you for the first dance? My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.",4,"In fact, I took up dancing quite recently, too.",4
2260,"Oh, really? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well. I'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner. Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like the samba and waltz? Yes. And what dances do you like best?",4,Waltz is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances.,4

2264,"Gorgeous! What should I bring on that day? Your tent and enough food and water. You mean, we can do many other things after the picnic, right? We can go fishing, chatting and camping.",4,What are we waiting for? Come on!,4
2265,"so... what kind of things do you do in your free time? I'm really into watching foreign films. what about you? I like to do just about anything outdoors. Do you enjoy camping? camping for an evening is ok, but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night!",0,have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters?,0
2266,"no, but I've always wanted to do that. I've heard it's a beautiful place to go. it's fantastic. My family and I are very fond of the place. do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there? sure, would you like to see them?",0,that'd be great. What kind of camera do you have?,0
2267,"I have a Canon SLR. so, you must be pretty interested in photography then. I'd call it one of my hobbies. Do you know much about photography? actually, I do. I took quite a few photography classes at University.",0,have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend?,0
2268,"yes, I was planning on going. Are you? yes.In fact, maybe we could go together. that'd be great. what time should I meet you there? how about at 11:00?",0,sounds great. see you then.,0
2269,"So Janet, do you do any sports? Well, I go to the gym a lot. I am a member of a gym nearby. Yeah, how often do you go? About three times a week if I can.",0,Not bad! Do you do any other sports?,0
2270,"Oh, hi Pam. When did you get back from Canada? How was it? The day before yesterday. I only visited Montreal and Ottawa, but I had a great time. Which city did you like better? That's hard to say... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing, too. A lot of museums and galleries.",0,And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it?,0
2271,"Which language do you speak? Well, I studied French at school, but I’ Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa Yes, I do. I’ m learning Chinese now on the internet. How do you find studying a language on the internet?",0,"It’ s not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn’ t too good.",0
2272,"I bet you find the character difficult to write! Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they’ re easy for me. So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right? Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?",0,"In a way, it’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.",0
2273,"Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting. Is this absolutely necessary? I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class. Will you be able to make up the work you missed?",0,I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.,0

2275,"Ms.Green, are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States, or do they differ in various sections? The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States. Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools? Most public schools in the United States are very good, and the majority of students attend the public schools.",0,"Which students go to private schools, then?",0
2276,"Children needing special instruction. Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools, and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education. But are the public schools good everywhere? No, public schools can be very different. Even in the same city. Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend?",0,"The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student. In most states, even the textbooks are free. There are no restrictions as to color, race, or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so.",0
2277,"Have you seen this? What? They killed another hostage. Oh, how awful. What a terrible thing to do.",2,I agree completely. I just don't understand what's wrong with them. Don't they have any humanity?,2
2278,"Well, maybe they've got a point. I mean, I suspect that they think the same about us. Yes, but that doesn't make them right, does it? Just because they think so? I guess not. My view is that we should give in to their demands, so that innocent people can stop getting killed. Come on, you can't be serious! We should never give in to terrorist's demands, otherwise where would we be?",0,"Well, that's probably true, but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it. A colleague of mine was kidnapped once, so perhaps I have a different view of things.",0
2279,"Where did you get your mobile? It's really cute. Oh, this? I got it in Singapore. Here, do you want to take a look? Thanks. Gee, it's really light! Yes, it is, isn't it? A bit too light, really. What make have you got?",4,I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look.,0

2281,"Are your ready to go to the supermarket? Yes, are you? I've got my money and my keys, so I'm ready. You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you.",0,It wasn't cold out this morning.,0
2282,"Well, it's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there! Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you? It does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping. That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.",0,Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here.,0
2283,How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know. The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night. Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse. I don't think we have anything to worry about. Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well?,4,Good idea. That will help us to warm up.,4
2284,"Is everything ready for the Christmas party? Almost. I’ Ve put up the decorations, and we’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles. I like the big star on the top of the tree. I’ ll put the presents under the tree later, how’ s the food. I’ Ve prepared most of it already and we’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know, crisps, biscuits, and things. Are you going to make the punch?",0,Yes. I’ Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won’ t take long to make. How many people are coming to the party?,0
2285,"I think everyone will be coming. Dave don’ t come because he has to go to his parent’ s home and they live in Scotland. Do we have Christmas pudding? Yes, we do. I hope we have enough for everyone. Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time? Yes, I did. I send most of them a week ago. I’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person.",0,I did the same. I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents. I hope I didn’ t forget to buy anyone something!,0
2286,"Hey, Brad. How was your day? Pretty good. Where are you going? I'm going home. Wait. We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed.",0,Is that right?,0
2287,"How about you, Chuck? Where did you grow up? Well, I was born in Ohio, but I grew up in Texas. And when did you come to Los Angeles? In 1978. I went to college here.",0,Oh. What was your major?,0
2288,"How are your wedding plans going? Very well. We’ Ve got everything taken care of already. Are you going to get married in the church? Neither of us is very religious, so we decided not to get married there.",0,Have you booked the hotel for the reception?,0
2289,Hi! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection. There’ s so much I want to do. I’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world. I just ran a search for music to download. I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit. Thanks. That would be very helpful. I’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want. There’ s too much information on the net.,4,"When you sent your emails, did you attach any files to them?",0
2290,"Yes, I did. There’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments, so I’ m sure I haven’ t sent anything nasty to anyone. When you use the internet, be careful not to give out your email address very often. If you do, you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things. That’ s good advice. I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself, such as my password and credit car number. That’ s right. Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites. Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit.",0,How do I do that?,0
2291,"Is there any more vodka in that bottle? Hum, I think there's enough for one more, yes. Marvelous. Pass it over. My name's George, by the way. Nice to meet you, George. I'm Irene.",4,"So Irene, what do you do?",0
2292,"How are you feeling, champ? Ready to go? You know, if I can keep up my workouts, I think I have a chance in 2004. In what? In gymnastics. I'm pretty flexible. Look! I can even touch my toes!",0,Can you do the vault?,0

2294,"Well, off the record, of course, but I hear that he's got terrible debts. He has his own company, and it's not going very well. Really? Well, I hate to say this, but I'm not surprised. Really? What makes you say that? Well, he doesn't look very honest.",0,"I know, that's the problem. He can't find any customers. It's a pity, really, because his products are very good. Oh, that reminds me. Did I tell you about my new laptop?",0

2297,"Oh, no! What about your presentation today? I'd like to do it, of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it. I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley? Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.",0,Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?,0
2298,"Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too? I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think. It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep.",0,"Yes, that's what I plan to do. Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it.",0
2299,"That bad, huh? Yeah, I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever. Well, I'll cancel your appointments for today. And I'll tell Mr. Morley. Thanks, Ann. Talk to you this afternoon.",4,Hope you feel better.,4
2300,"Susan, good evening. Why are you so dressed up? I am on my way out to a New Year’ s banquet. How do I look? Is my make-up OK? You look great. Your make-up is perfect. Do you think I should wear a different dress?",4,"No, the one you have on looks fabulous, especially with your hair like that.",4
2301,"Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear? With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect. Thanks for helping out. Now that I’ m ready, what are you doing tonight? Not much, just a house party with some friends.",4,Sounds fun. Anyone I know?,4
2302,What do you like to do with your free time? Study English. You mean you like to study English? Why? It gives me great satisfaction.,0,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.,0

You certainly do like teasing me, Mary. Well I'm in love with someone. The question is, how do I get his attention?",4,"Well, that's easy. Walk up to him and kiss him.",4
2306,You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager? Yeah. Are you sure? Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.,0,Just because he gets on well with everybody?,0
2307,"Would you like to come by and play bridge? Well, let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change? We haven't done that for a long time. Well, to tell the truth, I don't really feel like it tonight. I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired. Hmm.Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.",0,"Oh, we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different?",0
2308,"Well, do you have any suggestions? Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge? It's OK with me, but we don't have any beer and things. Well, shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.",4,OK.,4

I will get registered now at once. Do you know any training schools? I am not sure. You can search for them on the Internet.",0,"OK. look, I've typed driver schools, and there are so many results coming out.",0
2313,"Let me see. teetee Training School, summer program, 3,000 Yuan, learn how to drive within one month, and get driver's license within three months. 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep. I think so. Let's see the next one, 3,500 Yuan, summer program. Forget it. I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous. They offer many programs and there are many classes available. The charge is also fair.",0,"Search on the Internet then, see if we can find something more about it.",0
2314,"Did you have any hobbies? Yes, reading is my hobby. What kind of books do you like to read most? Many kinds of books.

Well, the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October, and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month. What do you think we can see during the festival?",0,"I don't know what to suggest. There're so many attractions, and they all sound interesting. One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town. You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations.",0
2324,"How do you know? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales. You're right. We're not really into used stuff. Well, I've grown to like second-hand things. I wouldn't have gotten through university without them! There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan, besides auction websites.",0,I use those sites. Hey! Let's go check out a flea market later.,3
2325,"Did you move into your new apartment? Yes, but I’ m afraid it’ s still a mess. I haven’ t put anything away yet. Don’ t worry.

2326,"Unfortunately, yes. What do you mean by that? I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station. It took me 20 minutes.

2335,"If I remember, he got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison. Yup, that's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless. I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire. That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.",0,I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years.,0
2336,"I am not sure what to do during the holidays, any suggestions? Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices.

I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city. you don't look very happy in that picture.",0,"no, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces!",0
2346,"so what did you do? we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market.

A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi, which is a major sponsor of the movie. He was able to get the tickets for free, and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece. You paid 50 dollars for each ticket? That's a huge premium over the regular price. Not really. Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market. Besides, I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day.",0,"Wow! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake. I really appreciate that. So, what time are we going?",4
2433,"Well, let's see. The movie stars at 10. We should be there at least 1 hour earlier, because there is a big line. I could pick you up at your house at 8, if that's ok with you. 8 pm, that's fine with me. Okay. So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8.",0,"Yeah, that's great. I'll see you tomorrow night.",0
2434,"Hurry up! Mom, I can't wait any more. Look out, honey. Let's come to the shoal waters. Follow me! OK, Mom. Can I swim now? I want to learn butterfly stroke. Honey, listen to me. First, you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out.",0,"Mom, it's so terrible. Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned.",0
2435,"Do be patient, Honey. Let's do it slowly and correctly. Oh, Mom, I think I'm not the right person for swimming. Come on, sweetie, you've done very well. It is the first step that is tough. Right, I'll make up my mind. Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong.",0,"Yes, well done. That's the way to go. How clever you are! You've got it.",0
2436,"Hi.Ed, what's up? Nothing. Doesn't look like it to me. Just get out of my face!",1,"Woo, easy.",0
2437,Leave me alone! What are you so ticked off about? I don't want to talk about it. Maybe I could help.,0,I blew the finally exam.,0
2438,Don't just stand outside. Come on in. Yeah. This is Alex. Remember? This is Sean. Nice to meet you guys.,4,Over there are Stacy and Rebecca. We're all on the school's tennis team.,0
2439,"Hello, Jack here. Hello, Jack. It’ s Mary. What are you doing in your office? I’ m working. I often work late on Thursday. I’ m busy this week. Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday?",0,"Tomorrow? No, I am afraid I won’ t be able to. I’ m going on business to Birmingham.",0
2440,"What about Saturday? Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening. Will you come round next Tuesday? Next Tuesday? Just a moment. It will be the twenty-first of May? Oh, dear. Hum, I promised my aunt I’ ll be at her birthday party.",0,What do you say next Wednesday then?,4
2441,"I hear you're moving to New York. Yes, I found a very good job down there. Well, we'll certainly miss you in Boston. I'm going to miss you folks, too.",0,Let's keep in touch.,0
2442,"we are going out for dinner tonight. Are you coming, Betty? I'm not sure. I have to check my schedule. Where are you going? oh, Jake made a reservation at Friday's. Jack?",0,"yes, the one with the R $ D team. Is that a problem?",0
2443,"I will never go out with him anymore. why did you say so? last time when we had dinner at the Smith's, it was a horrible experience. He had no manners at all! oh, really?",6,he made a lot of noises while eating. He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly.,0
2444,are you kidding me? How could he behave like that? it is true. Everyone kept looking at him. It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him. what a shame! Didn't he realized that? I have no idea. He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much.,0,maybe he should really something about eating etiquette.,0
2445,Hey Matt. I just got a job at a consulting firm. Congratulations. That's great! I'm so happy. I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore. When do you start?,0,I start next Monday.,0
2446,"You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know. I know. I'm a little nervous, but it's pretty exciting. I bet. You must be stoked. Yeah. I'm going to celebrate tonight. Wanna hang out?",4,Sure. It's on you right?,4
2447,"So, did I tell you about my New Year’ s resolution? I’ Ve decided to go on a diet. And you’ re going to completely transform your eating habits, right? Exactly! I’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat, no more chips, no more soda, no more fried food. I’ Ve heard this one before.",0,"But this time I’ m going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I’ m going to be a new man in one year’ s time!",0
2448,"Can I help you? Yes. I am a bit confused. My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age. According to the syllabus, the book is in the library, but I haven't been able to find it. Do you have your syllabus with you? May I see it? Yes, uh... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook. Oh, here it is.",0,Let me see. Oh yes. Your professor has placed this book on reserve. That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place. You need to go to a special room called the reserve room. It's down the hall and to the right.,0
2449,"I'm sorry - I still don't understand. You see, your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter. If one student removes the book from the library, it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it. So, your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve. So, will I be able to find this book? Yes, when a book is on reserve, a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book. The student can have the book for a few hours, and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time. That way, the book stays in the library, and all students have a chance to read it.",0,Okay. Thank you. I understand now.,4
2450,How time flies! Bill and Betty have already grown up. I can still remember our first date. Look at that big tree over there.,4,"Yeah, oh my god! It’ s still there. We have our first date right on there.",4
2451,Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then? You seemed to be dull at that time. But you agreed to go out with me at last. ( Smile ) I can’ t believe this for it’ s been 20 years since we got married.,4,So do you feel happy now?,4
2452,"Good morning Mike! Morning Sally! What's up? you seem many hurry! I am having an exam at 9 o'clock, It's already 8 thirty. Don't worry, I'll drive you.",4,Thank you very much!,4
2453,"How are your cases coming along? Very well, thanks, I will probably finish next week, but this is still a lot of work, I have been worked on in for six months, and i ' m so closed to end.

2454,What can I do for you? I need a passport. You can apply for one here. When can I do that?,0,"If you like, you can apply right now.",0
2455,That would be great. I’ m going to need you to complete this application. What else do I have to do? Then I will take your picture for your passport.,0,How long will it take?,0
2456,"Her dress looks funny. I wouldn't say that. It looks fine to me. Are you kidding She is behind the times. That style went out last year. Oh, come on, as long as it looks good on her.",0,"Well, you’ re really as out-dated as she is.",0
2457,What date is today? Why? Didn't you notice the roses everywhere? I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day! Don't you know?,0,"Oh, God. I just forgot it. I should have brought roses for my girlfriend.",6
2458,"What's your favorite sport? It's hard to say. Perhaps swimming is my favorite. I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity. In the scorching summer days, there's nothing like a cool swim. Currently, I go to the pool twice every week. Is the entrance charge expensive? Well, it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person. What a costly sport! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it. And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute.",0,"Haha, jogging? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring?",4
2459,I'll need a parking permit for next semester. Do you attend school during the day or only at night? I only attend class part-time in the evenings. Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile?,0,"I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school.",0
2460,"Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash, check, or credit card? I'll pay cash. Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle? No, thank you.",0,"OK, here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester.",0
2461,Thanks for lunch. It was delicious. It's OK. Next time lunch is on me. Don't be silly.,4,I'm serious.,4
2462,"Oh, no. It looks like we're late. Let's just sit in the back. We can still hear the service from here. There're so many people here. Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents? They're probably up front. The preacher's about to speak. Let's listen.",0,That was such a touching speech. He must have really known Taylor well.,0
2463,"Mary, Pam and I are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes. Do you want to come? Can you say it again slowly? Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us. Oh, I see. I'll have to sink about it.",0,Sink?,0
2464,"... The rings please. May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace, and continue in love until life’ s end. With this ring I thee wed. Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment. Honey, that’ s my pinkie. The ring goes on the ring finger! This one?",0,That’ s my index finger!,0
2465,"Have you heard about Michael's new home? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area. Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington? No, he's living in an old house in Warton. Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road?",0,That's the one.,0
2466,"His house must be worth millions! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford. The surrounding area is really peaceful, and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient. How can he afford that place? He didn't buy it. His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money. Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy? No one in the family expected to get a dime from him. It was quite a surprise.",6,What a lucky man.,4
2467,"He still has a complaint though. What's that? He wanted to live right on a bus line, but he doesn't. so, if he wants to take a bus anywhere, he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop. The poor thing. It must be difficult being him.",0,You can say that again.,0
2468,"hello. Where are you headed today? I'm off to Barcelona for a week. do you have your passport with you? yes, here you go. I don't need a visa to go to Spain, do I?",0,"fortunately for you, you don't. Next time, if you have any questions about visas, you should try to find out before you get to the airport.",0
2469,"that's good advice. would you like a window seat or an aisle seat? are there any seats available by the emergency exits? let me see here... yes, there's one left.",0,ok. I'll take that one then.,0
2470,"alright. How many pieces of luggage are you checking in? I like to travel light so I just have this one. if that's your only piece of luggage, it is small enough to carry on with you. Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive? yes, please. That's a fantastic idea. Which gate do I need to go to?",0,"you're here a bit early, so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour. Here's your boarding pass. Enjoy your flight!",4
2471,We can't wait any longer... I'm terribly sorry to be so late. I had an article... You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down? I can't afford to.,0,"All right.Now that everybody's here. Shall we be getting started? Miss Lin, are you ready?",0
2472,"Mark, you've been coming home late these days. What are you busy doing? Nothing important. I've been working overtime lately. How many hours do you work each day now? 12 hours, including 5 hours overtime.",0,That's tough indeed! Do you think your health can afford?,0
2473,"I don't care. I need money. Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, but do you think it's really worth? Yes, I think so. When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half. Oh, yes. Money comes faster in that way than otherwise.",0,But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited. Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage.,0
2474,"Which sports are popular in your country? Most people like football. More boys like football than girls. A few girls play it really well. Some people like playing basketball. Do many people like tennis? More and more people like it now. fewer people play table tennis than before. Many people like swimming, because it is fun and keeps you fit.",0,"In my country, many people enjoy golf, but it is too expensive for some people. A few people like extreme sports, but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.",0
2475,"Trina, will you marry me? Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared, of course I’ ll marry you! Oh, Babe, I can’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can’ t wait for all the adventures we’ re going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you. Oh, Jared! I can’ t wait for our wedding! I hope you don’ t mind, but I’ Ve already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning!",4,She what?,0
2476,"Oh don’ t worry, sweetie, I didn’ t know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ Ve got it all planned out. There’ s almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending. Four hundred? No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she’ s going to be a professional opera singer? Ah...",0,"And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend’ s band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what’ s their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we’ ll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!",0
2477,"When is your vacation going to start? I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation Oh, that's only a few days from now! How many weeks are you going to be taking? I'm taking two weeks now. but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter.",0,Where are you going now.,0
2478,"To the beach Have you made your hotel reservation yet? Oh, I don't need to do that. I'll be staying with friends You're lucky. It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August",4,"Just think, in a few days, I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy.",4
2479,"What a hot day! Yes, summer is coming. Where are you going this summer vacation? I'd like to go to Tianjin.",0,Do you want to go to the beach there?,4
2480,Hey John. I have some great news. What happened? I got a job offer from Dell. That's great. I thought you said you didn't get the job.,4,"I thought I did bad on the interview, but I guess I was wrong. I'm so happy right now.",4
2481,"What would you like to drink? Tea or coffee? Coffee, please. So, you also like Coffee? Yes, of course. I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning.",4,"Me too, but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it, as it's not very healthy.",4
2482,"I totally disagree. The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink. Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes, heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver. But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content, serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system, as well as other organs, and leads to addiction I don't think so. Coffee helps me wake up, keep alert, and improve my short term memory. Well, I adjust going to have to disagree with you. A healthy body wakes up without caffeine!",0,Maybe you are right to some extent.,0
2483,"May I have two tickets for Tiny Times? OK. What time? 2:30, please. It's 60 yuan, please.",0,"Sorry, we have student cards. We can get discounts with these, can't we?",0
2484,"Mike, what are you doing tonight? Nothing special. I just want to get plastered. I don't feel like drinking tonight. I'm gonna hang out at YY's. YY's? That place is boring. How about Xara's? It's real classy, and they keep the place spin and span.",0,"Yeah, but it's expensive. Nah, I'm going to YY's.",0
2485,"On second thought, I think I'll join you. They ' Ve just renovated the place. You may be surprised. Wow, they really went to town on this place! Quite a difference, huh?",0,"Sure is. Waiter, bring us two drafts, please.",0
2486,"Hey, Rose, how are you feeling? Much better today. Oh, Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl? It's a girl.",4,Can I hold it for a moment?,4
2487,"Sure.She is a peaceful child. Oh, how adorable! She's got your eyes. So they say. When are you returning home?",4,Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth.,4
2488,"Are you cold? Yes, a little. I wonder if we can change the temperature. I tried before. There are no buttons on the air conditioning.",0,There must be buttons. How do they turn it on and off?,0
2489,"I think it is centrally controlled. They control it at the main desk. Well, they have it too cold in here. I want to be warmer. I won't be able to sleep. I'm going downstairs for more drinking water. I will ask them. What did they say about the air conditioning?",0,They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same. They can't change it.,0
2490,"hello! How are you today? hi. I’ m feeling very nervous. I just had a test and I’ m not sure how well or how badly I did. it’ s not use worrying about it now. you’ Ve done test and you can’ t change any of your answers. that’ s true. I really should go home and prepare for the next test, but I’ m feeling tired.",0,let’ s go and get a coffee together. That will help you to wake up again!,0
2491,"ok. I feel like sitting down and having a chat. How have you been recently? oh, you know me. I’ m always happy! If I think I’ m getting into a bad mood, I call some friends and socialize or have a chat. that’ s a good idea. I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody. I hate spending too much time at home. I get bored of it really quickly. I’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people.",2,perhaps I’ m being too shy. I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests!,0
2492,"Hey, Lily, what are you doing? Waiting for someone. You mean the boy you met on MSN? You're right. He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him.",0,You must be joking. You can't fall in love with someone you've never met!,6
2493,"I know, but I keep thinking of him every day. And I get really depressed when he's not online. I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious. Well, this might be silly.

2497,"I'm sorry, Karen, but I can't. I have to work late this Thursday. Oh... that's too bad. Yeah. I really like Lesley. Actually, are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday? He's playing those two nights as well.",4,"Well, I can't make it on Friday either, but I'm free on Saturday night. What time does it start?",4
2498,"OK. I'll take your bet, as long as the winner gets to pick the movie. What about you, Nick? Sure. Do you want to go first, Sally? Why not! I rolled a five. The category is Best Pictures.

2501,Do you believe in god? Not at all. I’ m an agnostic. Do you? I’ m not sure. Why don’ t you believe there is a god? I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.,0,"I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, there are many things that science hasn’ t explained yet.",0
2502,"Cindy, I have this room to myself? It's all yours. It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan! Well, I hope it's comfortable enough for you.",0,I think I'm going to like it here.,4

Do you know how to get there?",4,"I kind of know where you live, but could you e-mail me your address?",4
2504,"I can do that. Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party? I would really like to bring my friend Jake, if that would be OK. Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine. Would you like some help with the food?",4,Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink.,4

Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood?,6

I’ ll show you how. I bet you’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes. This is only your second time skiing. This is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind. Relax. I can hold my own. Now, point your skis toward the bottom of the hill. Easy does it!",0,I don’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this.,0

2515,"Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK? I don’ t know. I didn’ t really feel like going out. I guess I’ m feeling a little homesick. Come on.We’ Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. I was. It’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’ t be able to home because I can’ t afford the airfare. I’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’ s cooking and being around my family.",5,"Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.",0
2516,"I see what you mean, but I’ m still bummed out. OK. how does this sound. let’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there! You know, I could really go for that. You don’ t mind being my wingman for tonight? Not at all! It be fun!

But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called "" Chinese-Style Divorce "".",0,Oh. really? I saw it two years ago. It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking.,6

Well, it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too.",0,I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.,0

What do you think now?,0,"There are lots of jobs, and almost everybody works. There is a high standard of living. People earn a lot, but they spend a lot to live. So there isn’ t so much money after all.",0
2565,"Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age, but young people want an unconstrained life. It would be good for both if they lived separately.

This Star Wars episode was incredible! Why do you think so?",0,"Well, one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects. State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes, so audiences have high expectations for this one, and I don't think they will be disappointed.",0
2569,"You are right. The special effects were amazing. And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes, weapons and creatures. It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie. Yeah! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes. I know exactly what you mean. Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling.",0,"I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting, but I don't think the character development was that strong.",0
2570,"Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie? No, the casting is great and the actors were excellent. They just didn’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues. The writing was also a little weak. Well, maybe. But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker. I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. I liked him too. He is so cute! You know, even though I was slightly disappointed, I can't wait for the next episode. I wonder when they’ re going to start making it and when it’ s scheduled for release?",0,"I've no idea. But looking at the success of Star Wars episode, I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon. I hope It will be even better than this one.",0
2571,"Well, you know what, don’ t do it, ‘ cause the minute you do, they lose all respect for you. Well, it’ s not like that. We just e-mail, it’ s really nothing.

This sounds interesting! Maybe my teacher isn’ t so horrible after all. So, are you going to read the novel or watch the movie?",0,There’ s movie? My teacher didn’ t tell me that!,6
2641,Are there many idioms in English? There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions. Can you give us an example? I'll look up the rate.

Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed? what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner? but we've done that many times. We want something fresh this time. okay, let me think. What about a party-and-movie night? We can rearrange our reference room, invite a band to play some music, order in some food and watch a movie later.",0,"sounds like a good idea, but a band sounds too expensive.",0

2698,"What do you think of the way people use and treat animals? I think most people treat animals well, but we are often cruel to animals. When we raise animals for food, the conditions they live in are often poor. Perhaps people should stop eating animals. We could grow more crops. What would you do with all the animals? You couldn’ t just let them go. Besides, some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.",0,We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.,0
2699,"That’ s true. I think zoo are a good idea, because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it’ s good for kids to see wild animals. I agree. I’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don’ t like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways. I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced. That’ s good news. The good thing is that most people treat their pets well.",0,"Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals, but those stories are rare.",0
2700,"It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies. Yes, I've been thinking about visiting you. I hope to get some advice from you. Which country do you want to go to? My field is electronic engineering. Which country do you think I should go?",0,"Were I in your position, I’ d go to America.",0
2701,"So how long have you know Jack? We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers. Really? You guys must be really tight. Yeah, We're buddy-buddy still.",0,"He seems sincere, and trustworthy.",0
2702,"Well, he is, but he can be conniving at times. What do you mean? Well, I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people. Oh, my! Really? I never thought he would be like that.",6,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's like that all the time.",0
2703,"So, can I trust him or what? Well, I think you should decide for yourself. But I need someone that I can count on for this job. Okay, Okay.You can trust him. I was just trying to give you a hard time.",0,Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight.,0
2704,"Are you free this Saturday evening? Oh, it seems there is nothing that evening. Would you like to go to the concert with me? I'd like to, where?",4,At our club.,0
2705,Can I help you? Yes. I'd like to borrow these books. Just a second. I'll see if I can find them for you. Thanks.,0,Here you are. You must return them within a month.,0

2707,How do you like Korea? I like it. It's a beautiful country. What part of the visit excited you most? The best island of Korea-Jizhou island.,4,Why?,0
2708,"Attractive scenery, pleasant climate, these make it charming. Yes, I think so. But there is also something terrible. What do you mean? Sometimes the traffic is too busy.",0,"Yes, you are right.",0
2709,"Did you go camping last Saturday? We went to the coast. It's really a nice place for camping, really good time around the fire singing and dancing. How many members were in your party in all? There were six of us.",0,Did you get caught in the bad storm?,0
2710,Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in. Where else haven't we been to yet? They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls. Sounds great! How many kinds of folk collections do they have?,4,"Well. there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city. That's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition half for multiple collection, and several individual display rooms for private collectors.",0
2711,"The show will be starting in a few minutes. We'd better go in and find our seats. Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls, aren't they? That's right. This entrance is for even numbers. That entrance over there is for odd numbers. Let's go over there. What a nice theatre! I guess it can seat hundreds of people.",4,Maybe you are right.,0
2712,"Now, you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China. I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me. I really don't know how to express my thanks to you. We are ready to help you. Will you be kind to say "" Thank you "" to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me?",4,I'd like to. I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again.,4
2713,"Isn’ t this great? I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food! This is very beautiful. Though I have to confess, I don’ t know the first thing about farming! That’ s fine! Don’ t worry about it! What was that?",0,"Relax, it was just a goat!",4
2714,"And that? It’ s just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later. What was that? Honey, seriously, It’ s just a sheep. Relax! Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.",4,You know what? I don’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I’ m going back to the city!,0
2715,"Well, thank you.Mr.Parry, for all your information.Just one more question. Yes, sir? Do you play any sports or games? I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer.",0,And what athletics did you play? Can you remember?,0
2716,"I was a runner_a long-distance runner. And now? No. I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married. Well, thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams.",0,"Certainly, sir.",0
2717,"Hey, that's a really nice outfit you have on. Thank you. I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not. Oh, you look stunning. Your dress really goes well with your shoes. I'm glad that you think so. I thought it might be a bit too revealing.",4,"No, not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?",4
2718,"I got it on sale down at the department store. When did you go there? I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, you should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale. I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?",0,Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.,0
2719,"Sometimes I think television is too biased. None of them are completely objective. That's unavoidable, but think, How would you keep up to date without television? Newspapers or the radio I guess. I just wish TV was more objective. Look, you can still learn a lot from watching television, you just need to be smart when you're watching. Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not.",0,The internet's a lot worse.,2
2720,I went to the doctor yesterday. I beg your pardon? I said I had been to the doctor the day before. What did he say?,0,He said I ' d got the flu.,0
2721,"Beautiful weather, isn’ t it? Yes, it is. Are you here on business? No, I’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges. I’ m going there for a tour, too. Is this your first trip to China?",4,"Yes, it is.",4
2722,"Tiffany, why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate? I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced. There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group. But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail? I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long. A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy. Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world.",0,Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net?,0
2723,"I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information, like your home address, until after several dates. Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger. Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites, do you have any stats on success rates? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet Well, for a site like ecrush.com, since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999, of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com, 300000 have actually matched.

2724,"Isabelle, you know I'm not interested in fame. Well, you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job, either. You know I'm interested in teaching. I'm looking for jazz students... Yeah, and every high school student in town is banging on your door, right?",0,I know they're out there. I'll find them.,0
2725,"Here's some dancing. See those guys stomping, clapping and shouting? They're practicing step-dancing. It sounds cool. The rhythms look really difficult. They basically turn their bodies into drums. There's a national step competition every year. Well, black people are supposed to be great dancers.",4,"Wen! That's only a stereotype. Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses. I'm not a great dancer, and you said you failed calculus.",4
2726,"What's the bonus like at your company? Well, it's OK, I suppose. We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary. Six months ' salary? Are you serious? That's incredible! Maybe. But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account.",0,"Hey, I know what that's like. I bought a BMW on my Visa card. Now the payments really hurt.",0
2727,"Well, you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments. I missed a credit payment last month. Now my bank account's overdrawn, and the company is threatening to take back my purchases. What did you buy? A new home health monitor. Health Monitor? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with! Listen, if I were you, I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical.",6,You're kidding!,6
2728,"OK, Ann, you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that? I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney. Mm-hm. How long were you there? I was there for almost a year.",0,"Oh, OK.",0
2729,"And I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast. Up to Frasier Island. Which is a world heritage site. And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the..., which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. So, did you, did you lose your finger? Almost. Almost. Ah, you're lucky. Um, it's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks, but not clams.",0,Exactly.,0
2730,I have just had my new paper published. You have done excellent work. I'm going to Britain. Really? How did you get the chance?,6,I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD.,4
2731,Guess who I saw yesterday? I don't know. Who? Avril Lavigen! The Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?,6,"Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, her poster, a CD...",0
2732,"So you're a big fan, eh? Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion designer, too. And she was in a movie once again, right? Yeah, though I don't think her acting skills are that great.",0,What was your impression of her when you saw her in person?,0
2733,I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades. Grades are based on many things What counts the most? Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.,0,Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?,0
2734,"Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each. What if we miss something? I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time. Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?",0,You will be able to track your progress during the year.,0
2735,"Okay, show me your card hand. Here's mine. I have three Kings and a pair of Aces. How did you get that? No need to show you my hand, I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw. Thanks again for buying the tickets. That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen. That silver electric guitar was really cool. They're quite popular now. Wasn't her voice good?",4,"That, My Heart Will Go On. It warms my heart. you know, JanetJackson, Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different.",0
2736,"Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music. Celine just seems to hit all the right notes. Have you heard Maria Carey?

2737,Sarah. You look terrible. What's wrong? My grandmother just passed away. I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this happen? A couple of days ago. I just go back from the funeral.,5,Is there anything I can do?,0
2738,No... not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time. I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital? Yeah. She died in her sleep. I'm sorry she's gone.,0,At least she didn't suffer.,0
2739,"I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together. I know. But I miss her. When my grandmother passed away, I frequently visited her in the cemetery. I always talked to her. Even though she wasn't there, I somehow knew she heard what I said. Yeah? That's what I was thinking too. Thanks.",4,It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day. We should get you something to eat.,0
2740,"I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already! Well, have you thought of getting an MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top. An MBA, hey... well my degree wasn't in business, the business schools won't be interested in me. Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.",0,GMAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?,0
2741,"Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts Okay, this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this? Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well! No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat!",4,Umm... That's the spirit!,4
2742,"hello, Kate! How are you doing? fine, thanks. How are you? fine. How are your term papers? oh, my lord. I haven't really started them.",0,how could it be? They are due two weeks later.,6
2743,"This is the good life! We have it good don’ t you think? Yeah of course! Although, don’ t you ever wonder what could have been? What do you mean? Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.",0,For example?,0
2744,"Like for example, if I hadn’ t studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to. I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn’ t have gotten married if I hadn’ t moved to this town and met Sally. You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn’ t even have met if I hadn’ t been in that car accident ten years ago! Well, I have no regrets!",4,I’ ll drink to that!,4
2745,"Would you like to go to the movies tonight? Well, I just saw a horror movie last night. It almost frightened me to death. Well, we could see something different like a detective film. I don't care for a detective film. It also makes me nervous.",0,How about a comedy?,0
2746,"No, I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful. How about a love story then? No, romance is boring. What's you opinion?",0,"Let's go to see a war movie, shall we?",0
2747,Hi. Bob! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight. So why don't we take it easy this weekend? Okay! What do you suggest? How about seeing a play? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater. Is that so? Why not?,4,"( looking at a newspaper ) Oh, dear me! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend. So we have to go to cinema instead.",6
2748,"What's on? Let me see.. um. Gone With the Wind. It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night. That sounds interesting. Which is the nearest? Ah. The Royal, I think.",0,What time does it start?,0
2749,"Why don't we go to the 7:30 show? It is convenient to us, I think. But we won't have enough time for dinner. Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show? Ah... I fancy going to the later show.",0,"Then, there's a 9:30 show.",0
2750,"Are you ready, honey? Sorry, not yet! can you help me to select the dress? i don, t what i should wear to fit thinner party. Just dress formal. How about transom?",0,"It is too loud, we’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner.",0
2751,"What's the matter with you, then? You look miserable. It's us. What do you mean by us? Well, we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember?",0,"What do you mean? We're talking now, aren't we?",0
2752,"I think it is time to study. Our chemistry exam is coming. Oh, I know. When is it? December 1st. What's on the test?",0,It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten.,0
2753,Well. I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam. Why are you so pessimistic? I'm not being pessimistic. I'm being realistic. My chemistry is so bad. I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation. Don't lose your heart.,0,Thank you. That's very nice of you.,4
2754,"Are you new here? Yes, I am. Is this your first year in college? I actually transferred here from another school.",0,Which school?,0
2755,I transferred from PCC. How do you like it here compared to PCC? I love it here. Do you like it better here or at PCC?,0,"Don’ t get me wrong. I like it here, but PCC is better.",0
2756,I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night. Who was it? Kate. She said she was too excited to go to sleep. She never cares about others.,2,It’ s true. Guess what we were talking about last night.,0
2757,"if you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese? why? Did tom pop the question? not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parents’ consent. let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right?",0,you are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I’ m between a rock and a hard place.,0
2758,"I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex. oh, how did you deal with it? I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up. oh, it’ s a pity. What was the matter?",0,simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.,0
2759,"like what? he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family. Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first. yes, he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.",0,so that's why it’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.,0
2760,"I don't know how to adjust my life. Would you give me a piece of advice? You look a bit pale, don't you? Yes, I can't sleep well every night. You should get plenty of sleep.",0,I drink a lot of wine.,0
2761,"If I were you, I wouldn't drink too much. I often feel so tired. You better do some exercise every morning. I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me.",0,"Why do you worry about your future? You're very young, and you'll make great contribution to the world. I hope you take my advice.",0
2762,"Hi Joe. You met my new assistant, right? Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. You are kidding, but she's so helpful. Tom... you are her boss, you kown.Of course, she's helpful to you.",0,Come on. She's like that with everyone.,0
2763,"Hey, you, pick up that piece of garbage! Huh? Me? Yeah, you. I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground. Can't you read the No Littering sign? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering, so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there. Why should I do that? It's only a piece of garbage. Why should you care?",0,"Because this is a public place, and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage.",0
2764,"How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing? I've never really thought about it before. I guess it doesn't bother me. Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping? I guess so. I usually buy name-brand clothing, shoes, and electronic goods. How about you?",0,I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!,2
2765,"I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money, I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds. I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time, but I don't think it always makes sense. Do you have a brand preference for anything? I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo, but I don't for higher-end items.",0,"What do you think about the "" impossible is nothing "" billboard on the high street?",0
2766,"Did you see the fashion awards last night? I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that. Not interested? Not really, to be honest. Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me.",0,But they are showing what will be all the rage next year.,0
2767,"All the rage with whom? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street. Did you know that fashion is cyclical? What, it keeps coming back? Precisely! For example, Flares were popular for a while, then went out of fashion. Now we can start to see them coming back in again.",0,Flares?,0
2768,"Maybe we all will be all things to all men. How terrible! But for the life, we'll be changed by this society. I really don't want to go into the world, I feel afraid of it.",0,Don't be silly. We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves.,0
2769,"You're late. I know I'm late. I'm sorry. I tried to call you to tell you, but your phone seems to be disconnected. My phone? Yes. An automatic message says your phone is not in service.",0,"Really? I had no idea. Let me check.Yes, it's dead. There's no dial tone.",6
2770,"So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late. But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls. About what? You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone. Oh, what can I do?",0,"Well, the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast.",0
2771,"Do you have a cell phone? No. I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone. Can you drive me? I will go to Ann's house. It isn't far. I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room. Yes, of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away?",0,"Yes, I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house, then we'll just return here.But if not, I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me.",0
2772,"Would you like to go to a concert tonight? I'd like to very much. All right, then.There is one at the new concert hall. Who's playing?",0,It's the Powell orchestra.,0
2773,"I am unsure how to add a class and need help. I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? Yes, I have an add sheet. After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?",0,"No, I'm not sure.",0
2774,"When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line. Thanks. I understand what to do now. It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet. That sounds good.",4,"Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!",4
2775,I found out when Jim's birthday is. It's this Friday. Let's plan a surprise party for him! Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food? That's easy. Anything else?,4,"Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, she can come too?",0
2776,"In spring, people are feeling refreshed. They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps. They feel they are full of spirits and energy. Women in particular. They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress. Well, when summer comes, the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening. No one would like to stay in the open air for long. That's true. In summer, the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool.",0,"I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects, especially the singing of cicadas.",0
2777,"In autumn, almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested. And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity! Well, winter is a season for relaxation, do you agree with me? Well, it's hard to say. For the fields and rivers, winter is a relaxing season, but for farmers, I think they might take a rest physically, but mentally they are still busy thinking, planning and calculating for the working of the next year.",0,Maybe you are right.,0
2778,"Hey Sarah, are you all right? You look upset. As a matter of fact, I am a bit upset. I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well. What happened? No one would listen to any of my suggestions. Instead, they just kept arguing with each other.",0,Who was chairing the meeting?,0
2779,"Bob. Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes. That's exactly what happened! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say. Then he expected everyone to agree with him. What was the meeting about?",0,We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient.,0
2780,"It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient. Exactly. I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share, but they just wouldn't let me finish. What should I have done to get my point across? You have to keep things short and sweet. When you get a chance to speak, try not to get into too many unnecessary details. Short and sweet? But what if I have to explain something complicated?",0,You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting. Not everyone needs to know all that information.,0
2781,"Let's go to the cinema tonight, shall we? Good idea. Is there a good movie on? What about ' Farewell My Concubine '? I've been wanting to see it for a long time. All right. But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose.",0,My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening.,0

2877,"$ 14,500. It only has 10,000 miles on it, so it’ s like a new car. Does that mean you’ re not going to take the train to work anymore? Well, sometimes, I think it’ ll be nice to drive to work instead. We’ ll see. Want to go for a ride? Yeah, sure.",0,Come on.,0
2878,What are your plans for this weekend? I'd like to hire a bike. I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday. If the weather's fine. I am sure it will be. It's been good so far this weekend.,4,I know a good place to hire bikes if you want.,4
2879,"Come in, come in, what can I do for you? Professor Donald, are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester? Yes, I am applying on it. I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior, but...",0,Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.,0
2880,"Good evening, John. Good evening, Mary. How are you doing? I'm doing fine, thanks.What ' s new with you?",0,Nothing special.,0
2881,"I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week? Sounds good.Sorry, here comes my bus.You call me, or I'll call you to make a date. I'll call you. All right.Gotta go, bye, keep in touch.",4,"Have a great day, take care, bye.",4
2882,"How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend? I'm not sure. I promised to help my sister move Saturday. How about Sunday, then? We could start in the morning. I might be able to do that. But I don't think I can do it well.",0,"Don't worry. It is a test of physical endurance, intelligence. Just to finish it is considered a victory for most.",4
2883,"Oh dear, my weight has gone up again. I am not surprised, you eat too much. And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help. No, I wouldn't think so.",0,I do wish I could lose weight.,0
2884,"Hi, Larry, how was your weekend? Not bad. We had a get-together with friends from college. I haven't seen many of them since graduation. How about you? Great. I hung out with Jo all day shopping, and the went out for dinner together. Sounds a good weekend. You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends.",4,"Yeah, I never thought we could be good friends either. We have our differences. She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed, but we still get along extremely well. We can talk for hours about anything.",4
2885,"That's great. I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes. When Jo and I are together, we argue a lot, but that's also part of the fun. Besides, I know she will always be there for me when I need her, and she knows I'll be there for her. It seems you two bring out the best of one another. Exactly. Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me.",4,"Yeah, you are so lucky to have found each other.",4
2886,"What’ s the matter, Sally? You look so unhappy. I had a bad day yesterday. What happened? I went to the library and lost my bag.",5,Your bag? Did you get it back?,0
2887,"Are you free this evening, Li? I’ m afraid I’ m busy tonight. I’ m having dinner with friends. What a pity. I wanted to go for a drink with you. What about tomorrow? Are you doing anything tomorrow?",4,"No, I haven’ t got any plans.",0
2888,"Sam, what shall I do with my stocks? Will I lose money? There’ s a possibility. What do you mean by that? I mean if you don’ t sell your shares now, it’ s quite likely that you’ ll end up losing your shirt.",0,Is that so?,0
2889,"You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year. Have you made yours yet? No, I’ m not sure I’ m going to. Why not? There’ s not much time left. Are you short of cash? No, thanks. I am okay.",0,You’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September...,0
2890,"Well, actually, I am thinking about living off campus. Do you have any idea how much that would cost? I know it would be more expensive. I think I could handle it though. It’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can’ t get anything done. You should study in the library the way I do. Think of the money you’ d save.",0,I’ Ve got to think it over some more.,0
2891,"What a wonderful party! I had a good time. How about you? I enjoyed myself, too. Shall I give you a ride home? Yes, if it's not too much of a trouble.",4,It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place.,4

2896,"What’ s the difference between football and rugby? Those tow games are quite different. First, there’ s the size of the teams. In football, a team has 11 players. In rugby there are 15 players on each team. The biggest difference is that in football, only the goalkeeper can use his hands. In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted. In rugby, players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates, don’ t they? That’ s right. However, players can only pass the ball backwards. They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates. That’ s a foul.",0,"I know how goals are scored in football, but how about in rugby?",0
2897,"If a team carries the ball over the goal line, they score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch. There’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn’ t there? Yes. Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball. This is called ” tackling ”, as in football. The ball is a different shape in rugby, isn’ t it?",0,Yes. It’ s not perfectly round like a football. A rugby ball is oval in shape. There’ s a match on TV this afternoon. Why don’ t you watch it with me? I’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we’ re watching.,0
2898,"What do you say to eating out, Maggie? Yeah, why not? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time. A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood. We can go there.

2899,"Who's that striking woman over there? Hm? Oh, that's Alice. She's totally mad. Don't get yourself in a room alone with her. Really? Why not? She looks great. Yes, I know, but she's dangerous.",0,Really? Tell me more.,6
2900,"Well, I'm not one to gossip, as you know, but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment. Wow, crikey. So what happened? Well, this is just between ourselves, of course, but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her, so she got revenge. I heard him say she was a dangerous woman. Wow.",6,"Oh, while we're on the subject, what happened to you and your secretary?",0
2901,"What is the movie you saw last night? It is a new film, ' Transformer '. How do you like it? I expected too high from that movie, but I was a bit disappointed about it.",0,But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week.,0
2902,"Box office can't explain everything. I do not think it is cheerful or well-made. The plot is old and the female character is not pretty. My sister has given me two tickets for tonight. It is called ' The life of Rose ', a French movie. What's it about? It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world. It is a kind of tragedy.",0,I prefer the tragedy. It is moving and makes me ponder about my life.,0
2903,"Who’ s that? It’ me. Susan Taylor Oh, please come in. nice to see you. On, what’ re you doing? You look as busy as a bee.",0,"Yeah, I’ m trying to decorate my house.",0
2904,"Do you like music? Well, it depends. Do you think the music is well-matched? No, I think the music is too fast.",0,How about the words of the song?,0
2905,"It sounds nice. I like it. Naturally it can arouse your feelings. Yes, I think so. It's very emotional. Of course, and I also like the rhythms.",4,Full of energy and hope.,4
2906,"Hey, Wen! Welcome to D. C.! Glad you came out to visit! Thanks for inviting me. Actually, I've never been anywhere with so many black people before. It's different. Howard is eighty percent black. But there are whites, and even Asians here. Thankfully, it's also coed. Great! Is your, too?",4,"Sorry, nope. But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight.",0
2907,"How could you handle living in such a big family? Does everyone get along? Sure. We love each other and take care of each other. In such a big family, there must be a head. Who's the head of your family? My grandpa. He has the final word about almost everything. My grandpa is “ President, ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President. ” My parents, uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions.",0,Is a family like yours common in South Korea?,0
2908,"No. Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family. Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller. In traditional families, the old people are well respected and taken good care of. Ho My family setup is a bit different. In New York city, there're only three people, my mother, my stepfather and me. During this summertime, I fly out to California and live with my dad. Dad's getting Of course there'll be a room for you! To be blunt, maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids.",0,Yours is a modern family. I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer. You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys.,0
2909,"But four boys! It will be a new experience, and you might as well learn to adjust to changes. You are right, I guess.The world keeps changing, and so do families. But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else. That's what I want. It is good to have goals in life. If California doesn't work out, come and visit me in Korea, OK?",0,That's a great idea!,0
2910,"Hello, Kate. Hi, Peter. I didn't see you last night. Where did you go? I was almost on line the whole night. Did you play network games the whole night?",0,"No, I listened to the music, too.",0
2911,"Ma, I really don't know how to thank you. I'm glad I was able to help. It's most kind of you. Don't mention it. It was the least I could do.",4,"If there's ever anything I can do for you, Don't hesitate to let me know.",4
2912,"Hey, Mary, can you cut that out? Cut what out I’ m not doing anything. The tapping of your pen on your desk. It’ s driving me crazy. Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup!",1,"I don’ t slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you’ re shouting into your phone all the time?",0
2913,"what do you think about all the different diets people go on? I don't think dieting is good for you. It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with! but what do you think about people who are obese? What should they do to lose weight? they need to eat healthy foods, but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day. They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.",0,so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?,0
2914,"sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small desert. how about drinking soda? many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever. If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda, try that's good advice. Have you ever tried taking vitamins?",0,"my mother used to make me take vitamins every day, but I don't take them anymore. Vitamins are good as a supplement, but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start.",0
2915,"John, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a personal question. I don't mind at all. All right. Are you married? To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single.",0,"Then, when do you plan to get married?",0
2916,"Bob, put on your shoes, your feet are really smelly. No foot gives out scent. But don't forget you are in a cafe. Never mind, the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed.",0,I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior.,1
2917,"hey Ayden, I was wondering if you could do me a favor. that depends. What is it? it's kind of a big favor. I'm absolutely flat broke, and I owe my landlady $ 200. she's given me until Friday to give it to her, but I don't get paid until next Monday. Do you think you could loans I'd love to help you out, but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well. I had to get a new engine put into my car, and that ate up my savings.",0,"if you can't give me the full amount, a fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.",0
2918,"let's see, I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $ 20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now. thanks a lot Ayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, if you aren't doing anything tonight, why don't you come over and have dinner at my place. that'd be great. Thanks! What time should I come over? how about at 6 pm?",0,see you then!,4

2920,"Wait for me a minute. I'll go over to the gym too. You? Yes, why not? Just let me get my gym clothes together. I didn't know you could exercise.",0,What do you mean by that? Everyone can exercise!,0
2921,"Yeah, I know. But you? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth. No, not at all. I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training. They have decent equipment at that gym. You're going to lift weights? Hah! Are you laughing at me?",0,I'm sorry. I just can't imagine you lifting weights.,0
2922,"Maybe not. But I want to start. I need to get in shape. I feel these past couple months that my energy is low. It's true. If a person doesn't exercise, they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running. Even in the winter. So I need to do something too. But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise.",0,"I know. But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles, and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool. How does that sound?",0
2923,I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place! There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite? Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?,0,No way! Do you have a flavors you don't like?,0
2924,"I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it. I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once. I think that would be horrible!",2,I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!,4
2925,"I heard that ben is forming his own band. it will be a rock and roll band probably. He’ s a very good guitarist. can you play a musical instrument?

I love music.,0

2927,"Yeah, I noticed. She must be really loaded. No way. Her old man is rich. He buys her anything she wants. Lucky her. Anyway, I think that is just as beautiful. I think you've lost it.",0,"Well, that's my opinion.",0
2928,Who is Cindy’ s husband? Cindy’ s husband is Ron. How many children do Cindy and Ron have? They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law.,0,Do they have any grandchildren?,0
2929,"Yes, they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys. Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws? Yes, she gets along with them quite well. Do they have a large family?",0,Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron’ s family.,0

2932,"I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat! I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses. I spent half of the weekend on a train! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets! our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes. I see. Well, then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip. It was really tiring for me.",0,I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today.,4
2933,"Hello! Is that the box-office? Yes. I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening, please.",0,"Just a minute please. Oh, I'm sorry, all the tickets for tonight have been sold out.",0

2939,"Shall we go to cinema this evening? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing. It’ s supposed to be really good. What kind of movie is it? I don’ t like many of his movies, actually. It’ s a thriller. It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead. I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts, so it might be interesting. I read a review today and the critic didn’ t seem to be very impressed.",0,What did the critic say?,0
2940,"What are your hobbies, Mr. Green? I like collecting stamps. But it's an expensive hobby, isn't it? Yes, you're right. What do you like to do in your spare time?",0,I usually play chess with my friends. But I like playing basketball best.,0
2941,"Are you satisfied with the dishes? Great, the lamb stew tastes incredible. I like it, too. I like the fish especially. It's so fresh, and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish. Yes, the food here deserves its reputation. Chinese food is one of my favorites 。",4,"If you like, I'll take you to a new restaurant next time, I just heard about it from my friend, and he was just raving about it. It's such a great Sichuan cuisine. Would you like to try that?",4
2942,"Hey Michelle. Good to see you. Are you at lunch? Oh hi Jim. No I just got back. I thought you were on vacation now. No, I wish I was! I just got back from Spain actually. Oh wonderful!

2943,"That looks like an interesting book. It is. It’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world, with brief descriptions of how they were build, their purpose, and so on. There are the pymeids. It’ s easy to see how they got that name! they don’ t have smooth sides though. They don’ t now, but most of them did originally. There’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States. It’ s very distinctive with its five sides.",0,Look at that cylindrical office building. I’ Ve never been seen one that shape before.,0
2944,Yes. Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape. Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They’ re not perfectly cylindrical. This is the world’ s largest sports stadium. It’ s a massive oval. What sports do they play there?,0,It says here that it’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings.,0
2945,"Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space? No, the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them. But not too much. As the space between galaxies expands, it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough. But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy. If galaxies are moving apart from each other, how can they collide? Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide. However, on average, when you compare two large enough chunks of space, the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other.",0,"Wow, you're really informative. Thanks a lot.",4
2946,"Isn’ t he the best instructor? I think * he’ s so hot. Wow! I really feel energized, don’ t you? I swear, I’ m going to kill you for this. What’ s wrong? Didn’ t you think it was fun?! Oh, yeah! I had a blast! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad. Sorry, I’ m just not into this health kick.",0,"Oh, no, get off it. It wasn’ t such a killer class.

2949,"Do you have much experience with kids? Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson. To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby. I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.",0,What about your mother? Did she help you?,0
2950,"Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’ s it. I had to care for them most of the time. I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day. Don’ t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work. Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.",0,"No. You see, I went back to school to get my Master’ s Degree when I was in my thirties. You won’ t be older than that.",0
2951,"Hey, Daniel, how's it going? Hey, Daddy, today I had really a fantastic history class. Wow, it's so strange for you to say things like that. What had happened?

2952,"Yeah, he, with his fleet, came across the Indian Ocean, and arrived at the east coast of Africa. Great, do you still remember when he started his voyage? Of course, that is from 1405 to 1433, which is in Ming dynasty. Good, by the way, do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you?",0,"Not yet, you know I have a lot of homework to do.",0
2953,"You should speed up, because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today. OK, great Daddy, after supper, I'll embark on it. That's my boy! Wait, Daniel, when is Pirates of the Caribbean on? Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow, who wants to find the treasure on the sea?",4,"Exactly, now, tell me the time.",4

2958,"How is everything going with your girlfriend? Didn't I tell you? It's over! Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I did't know that you had split up. What happened? It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up!",1,Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?,6
2959,"No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home! What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her? I wanted to, but I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, so I decided to just go home. I called her later that the night, but she didn't answer the phone. I can't believe she would do that to you. It's so dishonest-and rude!",0,I know. I still haven't heard from her. The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around.,1

2961,Have we handed out all the water? Yes. So what else to do now? Nothing. The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later. I see. How do you like the game?,0,"Terrific. There is one girl said, It is the best game I've ever watched.",0
2962,"Who do you think do better? Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, but also he inspired the whole team. Exactly. He is unbelievable. On the other hand, I think the other team won everyone's respect. The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning, but they just carried on and never lost their cool.",0,They were really tough.,0
2963,Let's do something different today. Like how? I would like you to give me a different hair style. What did you have in mind?,0,Give me a short haircut.,0

2966,"Hi, Francis. Oh, Mike. How are you doing? Not bad. It seems you are super yogurt lover. You have so many in your cart. Well, I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks. Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it? It tastes great and very healthy too.",0,"Oh, I haven’ t noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time.",0
2967,Hi! What are you watching? It’ s a program about islam. It’ s very interesting. Wow! So many people! Where are they and what are they doing? They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca. Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ”.,0,Why do they go there?,0
2968,"Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life. Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith. When muslims pray, they face towards mecca. That’ s right. Unfortunately, so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed. I heard about that. The pilgrims must walk around a large, sacred black stone.",0,"That’ s right. That’ s when accidents often happen. The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents.",0
2969,"Pilgrimages are common in many faiths. Yes. In England, Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages. Isn’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed? I think that place is Lourdes. There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there.",0,Do you think that there is something magical about that place?,0
2970,"Why do you want to go to the U. S.? I want to enrich my knowledge in management. The United States is an ideal place for me. What will you do when you come home? Before I work in the office, I was a teacher. So if possible, I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people.",0,Do you feel your English is good enough for the course?,0
2971,"Yes. You know, English is my present working language. Besides, I scored very high in TOEFL. Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States? I will support myself. In recent years, I have saved enough money for my study in the U. S. How long do you expect to stay there?",0,I will be there for three years.,0
2972,I don't know what to say. This can't be happening. Here's the obituary. It's really there? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare. But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work. Poor Femi. Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him.,5,This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five.,0
2973,"Dear Anna. I really love you. I love you, too. I want to take care of you forever. Will you marry me? Oh. My God! Are you serious?",6,Am I too abrupt? Did I scare you? Or you don't want...,4

Just like you celebrate Christmas, we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day, the Spring Festival. It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together. Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year.",0,"Christmas has more religious nature, while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday.

After that, the adults usually sit chatting, watching TV, or playing cards.",0
2976,"What are the children doing? They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks. I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year. Perhaps it is like what people told you. At 24 hours midnight, the time when the New Year really comes, we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other, and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper, in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money.",0,Who will get the money?,0
2977,We’ re going to the movies. Will you join us? I’ m very sorry I can’ t. Why not? I’ m afraid I have some business to attend to.,0,Then would you like to have lunch with us?,4

2979,"Are your ready to go to the supermarket? Yes, are you? I've got my money and my keys, so I'm ready. You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you.",0,It wasn't cold out this morning.,0
2980,"Well, it's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there! Well, I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then, as well. Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you? It does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.",0,That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.,4
2981,Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here. How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know. The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night. Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse.,0,I don't think we have anything to worry about. Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well?,0
2982,"At the Beijing Olympics, all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals. A clean sweep again! Yes. All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport. Do you know any secrets to China's success? In the first place, I think the whole nation is just fond of the game. It is well grounded with the mass. With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong, we can always spot a handful of potential world champions.",0,"So, the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership.",0
2983,"Sure. There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams, and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules. For example? They are subject to hard training. And you know what, for a player on the national team, personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions. They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other. Oh, dear! It's an encroachment on individual rights!",0,"Well, ping-pong is our national sport, and we just have to keep winning one honor after another. That's why many people think such rules acceptable. After all, they are funded out of taxpayers'money.",0
2984,"I can’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice! Why not! It’ s a classic. In fact, it’ s one of my favorite novels. But it’ s so old. Don’ t judge a book by its cover. Do you Kwon what it’ s about?",0,"No, not at all.",0
2985,"First of all, it’ s a romance novel, set in the early 19th century. I didn’ t realize it was a romance novel. What’ s the main storyline? It’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls. Why does he want to do that?",0,"Since he doesn’ t have a son, he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man. That way, all of his daughters will be cared for.",0
2986,"Won’ t they get his inheritance? No, that’ s the problem. Though they are well-off, once he dies, his house will go to his cousin. So, when he dies, the girls will have nothing. I see. This sounds interesting! Maybe my teacher isn’ t so horrible after all. So, are you going to read the novel or watch the movie?",0,There’ s movie? My teacher didn’ t tell me that!,6
2987,"Hello! Hi, Jenny! Jason here. It's great to hear your voice again. Hi, Jason! Long time no see. How's the hotel? It's pretty nice, but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon. Hotel living is not for me.",0,I know what you mean.,0
2988,"How about you? When are you leaving for Berkeley? I am leaving in two weeks. So soon! Well, I'd really like to see you again before you leave. Would you like to go out with me on Friday?

I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o’ clock. Is that ok?,0
2989,When do you want to have the open house party? How about next Friday? Friday sounds good. How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids?,0,I like that. Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax.,4

With love, Sue. """,4

2996,"Holly, I just heard some terrible news. Me, too. I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor. What? No, I heard that he has stomach cancer. His ex-girlfriend said it. That could explain all his stomachaches. He's trying to hide it from us.",0,Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck. Have you seen him?,0
2997,"Hi, Kate. Hi, Don. What a surprise! Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn’ t sure. We haven’ t seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now. Have you noticed what has changed?",0,"Oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?",0
2998,"Yes. I’ m on a diet, but I’ Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I’ Ve lost twelve pounds. Wow! That’ s great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break. What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I’ m taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday. Dance? You only go dancing? That’ s not hard. I can do that.",0,Sure.

3001,"Thanks for inviting me to your friend’ s wedding. I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony. Is that common? Well, some people use a standard set of words, but many couples today write their own wedding vows. Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting, but it didn't look like real rice to me. It wasn't. It was birdseed. We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it.",0,"Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, music and dancing, and interesting traditions.",0
3002,"So, Monica, what do you feel like doing this afternoon? Actually, I had a perfect plan for this afternoon, but it is totally ruined by the sand storm. I woke up this morning and found it was sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me. We were going to look for a new purse. Now it turned out to be like this. Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore. That’ s too bad. I hate sand storms too. It can be worse than any kind of bad weather. What’ s wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can’ t people do something to stop it?",0,"It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, it will not work overnight.

It is all over now. How was it going, anyway?",0,"I don’ t know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn’ t ask those as I expected. To my surprise, the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.",0

3017,"That's right. You should give it up, too. It's bad for your health. Stop talking like my mother. That's what she keeps saying. But it's true. It's a nasty habit. I can't think why I ever started. Anyway, it's obviously got you in its grip! What do you mean? What are you talking about?",0,I mean you couldn't give it up!,0
3018,What do you think of smoking? It’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others. What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking? Stop producing cigarettes.,0,But that’ ll affect the national economy.,0

3020,"Well, it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds. But besides a beautiful story, the cinematography is great. There is some really dramatic footage. It's really quite a visual feast. And the soundtrack is moving. Sounds pretty good. Is it a tragedy? The ending is a bit of a surprise. I don't want to ruin it for you. Oh, I like movies with surprise endings, although, sometimes they can be frustrating. Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend.",0,It would be a really good choice.

3028,"I never understand why these shops have so much liquor. What do you mean? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free. But why? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free?

3029,"Yes, of course. Didn't you know that? No, I didn't. How high is the tax? Well, it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal. Why would the government want to tax liquor so much?",0,"Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also, it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it, the government thinks it has the right to tax it.",0

3039,"Well, what did you get in English 101 last year? I got a 4.0 in that class. Well, I can't compare to you. I got a 3.1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder. It's not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade.",0,Oh. That helps. Thanks.,0
3040,"Hello, Green here. Oh, Mr Green, my name is Jianshan. You don't know me, but I'm a friend of David Smith. Oh, yes.

The workshop topic was resolving personal problems. It was led by a professional human resources director. The teacher had a lot of experience, and I think we were all given a really good base to start with. The workshop was only one afternoon long, do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours? It depends on the topic, the teacher, and the way the course is set up.

English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it. Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent.

There’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays. Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others. I have a deposit account with my bank. There are some restrictions on withdrawing money, but the interest rate is much higher.",0,I don’ t have one. I prefer to buy shares. My bank also provides a share trading service.

Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices.

Young people are attracted to that field in particular. There’ s also been a big growth in education. There’ s been a growth in that field in my country too. A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills. The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers. They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others.",0,I noticed that too. What are the people learning?,0
3161,"In my country, they are usually studying something business-related, such as marketing, management techniques, and human resource management. I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future. That trend has already begun in my country. In particular, there’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers. Which kinds of jobs are less in demand? Those in traditional fields, such as agriculture and heavy industry. Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper.",0,"Yes.

You always give such amazing presentations, I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow. Sure, it's easy. First of all, the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple. People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans. Stick to about three or four points, give an overview of the points, then present them one by one, and then summarize at the end. Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered. What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation? Do you think I should use PowerPoint? You should consider the size and interests of your audience. In other words, who is listening, and what do they want to hear... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention, but be careful not to go overboard.",0,"I think I can put something together, no problem.

But I'm still paying for it, you know.",0
3168,"I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name. Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that? I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans. I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.",0,Yeah... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate. I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare.,0

Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn’ t have gotten married if I hadn’ t moved to this town and met Sally. You see! Everything happens for a reason!

Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’ s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’ s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting. I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart.

There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them. Is that type of plant found in this country?,0,"No, it isn’ t. it’ s a pity, because I’ d like to see it in action.",0
3347,"So would I. what other unusual plants did they show? They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, when the insect collects the nectar, it also takes some pollen from one flower to another. That’ s very specialized. So, the insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, the other would too. That’ s right. That’ s one reason why it’ s so important to protect every species.",0,I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.,0

You need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn’ t very usually effective.,0,You’ re right.

He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.

3524,"You mean they're kicking you out? Not really, they just don't want me living at home. My older sister did that, and she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, it got harder and harder for her to move out. Well, it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with, but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so. My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well, and because of that, they want me to be more independent. They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own.",0,"I know I need to learn that myself, but I just don't have the money for it at the moment. Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place.",0
3525,"I'd love to continue this conversation, but I really need to go now. I have to get back to the office. Well, let's get together soon. Okay. Would you like to have lunch some day next week?

After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer.,0
3536,"Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me! I’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me! Let’ s get started! Ok, let’ s start opening some presents!

3537,"I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise. That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise. But I work hard all the time for long hours. Often I have no time for lunch. Yet, I am still getting fatter. Bill, you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals.",0,"I know you're right, but what can I do?",0
3538,"Good morning, you look very tired. Yes, I nearly didn't sleep last night. Did you hold a party or something else yesterday? No, I just watched Supergirl, and it began too late in the night.

3539,"The contestants are different. These girls perform in free styles. Do you have much time watching TV? I think less than 3 hours. This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs. Too many ads between the programs. I prefer listening to the radio. I don't like ads, either. But ads could bring big profits to the TV station.",0,"If they could make beautiful ads, I could bear.",0
3540,"You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes. All right. But how? Just imagine, if a horse can fly, if a bird can swim... and things like that. I see. But could you give me another piece of paper?",0,"OK. Here you are. Anybody who wants help, please come to me.",0
3541,"Mom, I've got something to tell you. So, please! Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom. He is putting on grand airs. I bought you a new one last year. Isn't it handsome?",0,It is great. But Tom's bike is so much better than mine.,0
3542,"Frankly, he is more well-behaved than you. Nothing of that sort! Why hasn't the bus come yet? Every morning we have to wait for so long. Mom, it's OK. I will buy a big car one day. It is faster than the bus.",0,Really? I am looking forward to that. What about the traffic?,6

3547,"Thanks for coming. How about next time we meet at my place? And I’ ll treat you to Chinese food. I know how much you like it. We can order in and watch video too. Anything you like, I promise. Great idea. I’ m looking forward to it. See you then. Well. I really do have to go.",4,Good night then.,4
3548,"isn't it wonderful walking here? what do you mean? I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us. yes, look over there. That's the Empire State Building. My book says it's 102 stories tall.",4,it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned?,4
3549,"you're right, but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering. what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue? quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center.

3551,Didn't I? I'm doing business studies. Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating? Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really. What about your friend Zoe,0,She's from Australia. She lives in Sydney. Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy.,0
3552,"Accountancy? Really? She must be very good at figures. I guess so. What about you, Simon? I'm studying law. Great! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer.",4,"Sure, welcome anytime",4
3553,"Emily, are you getting rushed by a sorority? More than one. I think the count is now three, if I remember correctly. Wow. I'm getting rushed too, but just one.

3559,"Hello Mike! Would you like a drink? No, thank you. I had too much to drink yesterday evening. I had a bad hangover this morning. My head felt terrible. Were you celebrating something? Yes. It was a friend’ s birthday party. We drank all kinds of things-beer, wine and spirits. After midnight, we were even drinking cocktails!",4,It’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks. You should stick with one for the whole evening.,0
3560,"I know, but it was a celebration, you Kwon? I don’ t think I’ Ve see you drunk. I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints. You are a sensible drinker. Anyway, I’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening. I don’ t’ want another bad hangover. Let me buy you a soft drink then. How about a coke?",0,Yeah. That’ s a good idea.

3562,"Excuse me, do you know where the visa office is? Yes, I do. I’ ll walk you there. Thanks! Are you applying to study or work abroad?",0,I want to study abroad.,0

3565,"What does your sister look like, Mike? Well, she’ s tall and pretty. Is she like you? I suppose so. We’ re both friendly and easy-going.",0,Is she as clever as you?,0
3566,When were you born may I ask? On 20th May 1963. Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar? 27th day of the fourth month.,0,"By the way, could you tell me when the film will begin?",0

It’ s not you, it’ s me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for! So, what are you saying? You’ re breaking up with me because I’ m perfect? Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ ll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I’ d only hurt you, I know I’ d only make you cry.",0,"Baby, come on. Don’ t do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don’ t leave me.",0
3570,"Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts? No. What? He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail. No. Really, what happened?",6,"Well, it was all a big mistake, actually. He got home on Friday night really late, and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, so he was really drunk.",0
3571,"Was he out with the guys from the bank? Yes, I think so. Oh, yeah, they always get really drunk. Well, anyway, he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, so he couldn't get in. He lives alone, you know.",0,"Oh, really. I thought he lived with his wife.",6
3572,"No, she left him last year. Oh, really? Do you know why? Hang on, let me finish telling you what happened. Where was I? He lost his wallet and keys.",0,"Oh yes, well, he tried to climb in through the bathroom window, but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot. The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress, so they called the police.",0
3573,"Oh, no. Yes. So when the cops arrived, they didn't believe his story So then what happened? Well, when he sobered up, he called someone from work to come and bail him out.",0,"Well, that's a bit of a tricky situation.",0
3574,"What's your opinion about childless couples? Will you choose to have no kids? To be honest, I wouldn't. Why? Do you have to make a choice now? Not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.",0,What's the puzzle?,0
3575,"My husband and I prefer to have no kids, but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids. Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way. Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night. Oh, really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.",6,But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.,0
3576,"Definitely. You know, I often overhear our neighbor, the young couple, fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness. Don't worry. I think in most cases, children are the glue that keeps a family together. I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child.",0,Sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.,0
3577,"You’ re a big fan of Andy Lau, aren’ t you? Yes, I’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD. I adore him. He’ s my idol. How come you don’ t have all of his films on DVD? Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, especially the ones where he only played a bit part.",0,I see. I’ m sure you’ ll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.,0
3578,"Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday. Are you a member of his fan club? I was, but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, so I’ m not a member now. Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?",0,Of course! I bought two copies.,4
3579,"How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger’ s ”? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet. Oh, it was great. We had seafood buffet. They do one every Friday. The waiters and waitresses are very good. They are very attentive, but don’ t hang around the table. I like the buffets they have, but if often order a la carte, because I don’ t feel extremely hungry. I like the wine list there too. Yes, so do I. they have wines from all over the world. There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket. We ordered some Australian red wine, which tasted delicious and wasn’ t expensive.",0,"Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, but the don’ t do that at “ ginger’ s ”. what was included in the seafood buffet?",0
3580,"They had almost every kind of seafood. There were oyster, shrimp, prawns, crabs, and fish. I ate a lot of smoked salmon. Did they have lobster? No, they didn’ t. you could order it from the menu. I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet. Yes, it probably is. I don’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants. You never know whether they are fresh.",0,"I know. I didn’ t eat any, but a few people in our group did and no one got sick.",0
3581,"Hello there! Come on in! Don’ t just stand there! Come and take a seat! Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy. Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny!

It’ s so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!",4
3582,what do you think about this store? I heard it’ s a posh store that’ s only got branches in big cities. I love this store. The only problem is that it’ s extremely expensive. don’ t worry. I’ Ve decided that for your birthday I’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress. really? I thought you hated shopping?,4,"I do, that’ s why you should appreciate this gift!",4
3583,"sure. That’ s really nice of you. Let’ s go in and try some things on. how about this red dress? I think it would really suit you. that’ s gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8? here you go.On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it’ s on special offer today.",4,I think this color isn’ t quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white?,4
3584,"Judy, what is everybody talking about? Haven’ t you heard? Richard was fired by our manager. You’ re kidding. It can’ t be true. Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.",0,Really? I’ m surprised.,6
3585,"Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods? It could be. There are floods in this country almost every year, but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent. It seems that the climate in this country is changing. The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.",0,I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.,0
3586,"I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers. Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsborg is less than $ 1. Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you? It's fashionable.",0,"Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.",0
3587,"Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun. How? By drinking? Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed. When did you begin to drink?",0,"It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink? '",0
3588,"hello, Deva, how are you? can't complain. What about you? not bad. Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband? I've heard. She looks quite depressed.",0,Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.,0
3589,"I heard they were just married for 5 months. yes, she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things. yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden. you said it. You know, they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.",0,maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.,0
3590,"Here's Copellini's, my cousin's store. Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end. Admit it. You just think of Mussolini. No, I'm an art lover, so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli!",0,"Ah, yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.",0
3591,"Thanks for the pizza. It was delicious. It's okay. Next time, it's on me. Don't be silly.",0,I'm serious.,0

3594,"Seriously? But you are such a genius. Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure. Well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ. You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks.",0,"OK, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming?",0
3595,"What does this have to do with me? You know all about coffee. I need your advice, so I won't look stupid when I order. Order tea. Isn't that what you like to drink? Come on, Hugh! Tea is for wimps! Please, I need your help.",0,"If you want to be macho, order a double shot of espresso.",0

3614,"You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment? No, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while. But you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company. We did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work.",0,"Can't you hang out with them, too?",0
3615,"I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out. Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you. I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her. It can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.",0,You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.,0

3622,"Hey! How was your first day of class? I’ m in level two and I’ m loving my class this semester! It’ s great being in a class of international students! Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. That’ s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’ s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians! That’ s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

The plot was too complicated for me.",0
3626,"Did you read the books before you watched the movies? No. did you? Yes, I've read them many times.

3631,"Woo hoo! This just might be the start of the rest of my life! What happened? I’ m in the market for a job! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write. I’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally. And you know I can be charming in interviews. Goodbye my penniless days! Hello salary and a career! Ben, we’ re fifteen. What kind of job are you looking for?",0,"Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant.

And we can put one on the floor by the bed. Over there.,0
3636,"Alright. That's a good plan. What about the desks? We have two desks, one by the window and one by the door? Which one do you want? Well, the desk by the window is nicer, of course. Don't you think? Yes, I agree. So since I got the bottom bunk, why don't you get the desk by the window? That would be more fair.",0,Alright.,0
3637,"I mean, we could flip a coin for it, but I would probably win again. I'm incredibly lucky you know. Especially with girls. Is that right? Yes, that's right.

That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids. Don't they ever relax?",0,"Of course they do.You know, Eliza, before I went over there I thought the same thing. I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there, and taught them, I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education. More than American parents are. And that is good. American kids don't study enough.",0
3683,"Asian cultures value learning very much. I know that. So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing.In America, too many parents don't pay attention. But aren't the kids tired out? I mean, they go to school all day, and then they go to school in the evening too. As an English teacher, I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible. I tried to have a good time with my classes. The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it, they learned more. So it was a good experience.",0,Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient?,0
3684,the dinner was really good. It knocked my socks off. that's very kind of you to say so. Let's try some after-dinner wines. great. Sweet wines are my favorite. They always make a great finish to a decisions meal. do you prefer brandy or ports.,4,"port, please.",4
3685,excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor. the port is exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right? yes. You always have a good nose for wines. next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.,4,"oh, what's that?",4
3686,"it's made from naturally frozen grapes. why not? It sounds great. oh, here's to your health. thanks. Cheers.",4,cheers.,4
3687,"Hey Mike. What are you doing tonight? Nothing planned. How about you? Work is kicking my ass. I'm so stressed. Let's go grab a drink. I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, it's been quite stressful here too.",0,I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.,0
3688,My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money. What's changed? My wife has been pregnant for 7 months. I see. I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy.,0,My wife will be going back to work soon.,0
3689,"We came too early. There're still three hours before the performance starts. I know. Sorry, I shouldn't have rushed you, but I just couldn't stay at home and wait. Never mind. What about taking a look around the theater? Why not? I'd love to do that.",4,Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. ),0
3690,"Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them? Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery? I surely do. They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that. No, no, no. They are all handmade, girl. You know, the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework.",0,Unbelievable! I could never do that.,6
3691,"Very few can. That's why these clothes only appear in the museum. Listen! Some people are singing outside. Is it the opera? Oh, yes. I heard there was an opera fans club. They are probably practicing now. Wanna have a look? Yes, let's do it.",4,Follow me. Make sure not to interrupt them.,0
3692,"Anna, that outfit looks wonderful on you! The color goes with your trousers perfectly. Thanks, Carla. That's quite a compliment coming from you. You always dress so tastefully. Well, that dress certainly shows your good taste. It must have cost a lot. No, not much. I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off.",0,"Really? You're an amazing bargain hunter! Next time there's a sale, promise you'll let me tag along with you.",6
3693,"Well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip? It was fun, I tell you. Tell me about it, will you? Well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight!",4,Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?,4
3694,"Sure, we wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour. You were lucky then. Yeah, we spent the whole morning under the tall trees. We had our picnic there, too. What did you do after that?",4,We went for a swim in the sea. That was the biggest part of the day. Just look at my nice tan!,4
3695,"Where can I buy textbooks? First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that? Yes, I have that. Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?",0,"No, I don't know where the bookstore is.",0
3696,"Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money? Really? How can I do that? Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today? No, I can't make it today.",0,I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1,0
3697,"Hey Lydia, what are you reading? I’ m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling! What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes? It’ s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’ m an Aries. When were you born?",0,January 5th.,0
3698,"Let’ s see... you’ re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we’ ll both have interesting summers! That’ s bogus. I don’ t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. No, it’ s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’ re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?",0,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!,0
3699,"Oh, my god. How can you stand living in such a messy dorm? Our place is spotlessly clean, compared with others. Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester? In fact, I just swept the floor three days ago.",0,I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system.,0
3700,"You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now? I'm sorry, It's all my fault. You are always like this. I've told you many times not to tell her. Sorry, I had no intention.",0,"It's too late to say sorry now.Oh, what am I going to do?",1
3701,"Are you alright, Ethan? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are. To be honest, Ava, I've just had a really bad day. What happened? First, I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work.",0,What did your boss say?,0
3702,"He told me that if I showed up late one more time, he'd fire me. He's so mean! That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work? That was my second time. The first time, I was in a car accident. Is your boss Chinese?",0,"No, he's from Australia. Before I met him, I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going. I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things.",0
3703,What are you going to do? I think I'm going to look for another job. I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss. That sounds like a sensible plan. Do you want me to help you with your job search? That's very generous of you. Thanks for the offer.,4,Don't mention it. That's what friends are for!,4
3704,"Hello, Dora, I haven't seen you for a long time. Where have you been? I didn’ t go anywhere. I stayed at home. What's up? You look unhappy. Nothing. I just feel very lonely in this city. I miss my family.",5,"Oh, I know. Sometimes I have the same feeling with you. But you'd better not be so emotional.",0
3705,"What book is that? I just bought a new atlas. I’ m looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That’ s a vast country. Canada, china, and the use are huge too. There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.",0,"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, but compared to many countries in other continents, it’ s not very l",0
3706,"Tonight is a party night! What drinks do you think we need? Well, not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day. I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks, Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine? Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet?",0,"No, once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, the better.",0
3707,"Hi, John! I haven’ t seen you for ages. Hi! Yes, it’ s been a long time. I’ m really glad to see you. I’ m glad to see you, too. How’ Ve you been? Just fine. How is everything with you?",0,"Not bad. I finally bought a house. It’ s an old one, but built really solid. It is close to here. Do you want to come over for lunch?",0
3708,"I’ d like that, but I’ m flying home this afternoon, and I told my parents I’ d meet them at the airport for lunch. OK, next time you’ re here. That’ s a deal. I heard that you moved to Florida.",0,"Yes, I’ m in Titusville. The space shuttle is launched from near there. I’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches.",0
3709,Tell me more. The shuttle launches are beautiful. I saw one that took off at midnight. The whole sky got bright. Sounds great! I’ m pretty happy living there.,4,"I want to see Disney World, Sea World, Universal Studios, and Weeki-Watchee Springs.",0
3710,I’ Ve been to all of them. I’ m jealous. I’ Ve never been to Florida. The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting. Come down for a vacation sometime. I’ ll take you to Disney World. That sounds great! I’ ll take you up on that invitation.,4,"I hope you do. And keep in touch, OK?",0
3711,I sure will. Here’ s my business card. Send me an email once in a while. Count on it. And here’ s my card. Don’ t hesitate to call me anytime. Thank you. I’ d better get going. I don’ t want to be late for lunch. Mom would worry.,0,"Well, I’ m really glad we bumped into each other. Have a good trip.",4
3712,"I'll tell you something that's good about action movies. The special effects are great! But they are so silly! They're not art! That's just your personal prejudice. Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic? James Cameron, of course.",0,"Well, did you know he was also the director of The Terminator?",0
3713,Can I help you? Yes. I am interested in applying for graduate school in America. We have some catalogues from U. S. universities. You may check in the reference stacks over there. Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools?,0,"Well, generally in the U. S. each university has its own outstanding fields. But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th.",0
3714,"Can you be serious for a moment, we've been dating for 6 months now, I really like you. I'd like to take a relationship to the next level. So what are you trying to say to me? It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship. It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating. How should I say it?",0,I don't want to be like this. I think we should get step further.,0
3715,"It has only been 6 months, our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate. We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over. Like what? Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek. It was only the cheek.",0,"That is ok, then? Starts on the cheek? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car.",0
3716,"How did you get around over there? Did you rent cars? No, that would be too expensive. We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, as often as they want. I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot. Yes, they do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.",0,"I know. Our train system is lousy.And besides, Americans love their cars too much.",0
3717,"I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains. It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars. Americans love cars for different reasons, I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people. Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what? Probably, in the future, Americans will have to change.",0,"Why do you say "" have to ""?",0
3718,"Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious, world governments will have to start limiting car use. Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important. Wow! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon. I have to get home. Do you want me to give you a ride?",0,"No, no problem. I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner.",0
3719,"It's raining outside, Catherine, it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown? It's very hot, the temperature is often over 40C. Do you like the weather in Seattle? Not really.But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.",0,Why?,0
3720,"The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day. What about the weather in Boston? I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter. Is it very cold in winter?",0,"Yes, it is.But it's nice in spring and fall.",0
3721,I want to say goodbye to everyone. You’ re leaving so soon. When are you off? I’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning. how about I come and see you off?,4,You really don’ t need to.,4
3722,"Ok. I’ ll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon. I hope so, too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything. You’ re welcome. Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.",4,Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.,4
3723,"Herman, why are you so excited? I have met a beautiful girl. Have you fallen in love? Yes. At first sight.",4,Can you describe the situation at that time?,0
3724,"What an attractive blouse, You look so pretty in this blue dress! Really? Thank you. I bought it in Spring Street yesterday. It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt. Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so.",4,Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste.,4
3725,What college are you attending? I am in Nanjing University. I am a junior. Why did you choose to attend that college? Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing.,0,What kind of college is it?,0
3726,"How do you like the play? It is very dull, and the production isn't very satisfactory, either. You're absolutely right. I think the acting could be better. To be fair, both the costumes and scenery are marvelous.",0,Maybe you're right. But I really don't like it.,0
3727,"What are you studying all day long for? It’ s summer vacation! I know! I hate it! But I’ m taking this crash course in math. Why? I have to take my exams for getting into the university, so I need to prepare.",0,Do you think it will help?,0
3728,"Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie? Oh, yes. You? Yes. What did you think of it? I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it?",0,"I liked it, too. It was scary, but not disgusting. I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. He's brilliant.",0
3729,"Hi charles, I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian. You did? that is great! Yeah, I am having a party this saturday night, a sort of house warming, and i want to invite you. are you busy? No i am free, i will be there, what time the thing starting?",4,Around seven.,4
3730,"Ok, great, should i bring anything? No, but thanks for offering, actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat, do you have any? sure, I will be happy to bring a few, what is the address? Don't worry, I will come to pick you up at about six thirty.",4,Got it.,4
3731,"Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night? No, but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend. Yes, that was surprising. I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go. They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood.",0,They're also one of the richest couples. They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want.,0
3732,"I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars. Did either one of them win an Oscar this year? I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, but I don't think he won anything. Tom Cruise may be handsome, but I think he's a bit crazy, don't you?",0,"Yes, his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous.",0
3733,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves. People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated. I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you. That's true. I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go.,0,Thank goodness we're not rich and famous!,4
3734,"Oh, my God! I've been cheated! What? What did you buy? It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it! What is it? Why did you buy a brick?",0,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",0
3735,And? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. And it's a brick? Yes.,0,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,0
3736,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?",0,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
3737,"What do you like to do in your spare time? I am a girl of many interests. I like dance, chess, collecting stamps, travelling and taking photos. What kind of dance do you like? I like rumba and tango.",0,Great. I am not interested in Chinese chess. It is too difficult for me.,4
3738,"You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier. OK, I will try. As for stamp, don't you think it is an expensive hobby? Yes, it is. But it is full of fun and knowledge. What about you, what do you like to do as hobby? I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn.",4,Sounds pleasant.,4
3739,"I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly? Yes, it's one of the main air pollutants. Factories don't emit it directly into the air. It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight. Sorry? What does VOC stand for? Oh, Vous are ' volatile organic compounds '. That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint.",0,"So, what damage does ozone do to the environment?",0
3740,We’ re going to the movies. Will you join us? I’ m very sorry I can’ t. Why not? I’ m afraid I have some business to attend to.,0,Then would you like to have lunch with us?,0
3741,"I’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now. Would you like me to give you a lift? No, thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there. Come on. It’ s no trouble at all.",0,"Ok, thank you.",4
3742,"What sports do you think women excel at most? I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in, like football. I mean which ones are they better at than men? Why do you care? Women and men are different all around. I don't think they can be compared.",0,That's a good point. Let me change my question. What sports do women like best?,0
3743,"I am going on my first date tonight. Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear? Well, I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear. That makes you very graceful and mysterious. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let me try it. Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace. Very attractive on formal occasions.",0,Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes?,0
3744,"How's your new car? Perfect! Couldn't be better. You made a good choice, then? It's just what I want.",4,No regrets.,4
3745,"Hey, let's eat out tonight. What's the occasion? You won the lottery? No. Just want to relax a little bit. You don't have to win the lottery to relax, do you? Well, I am kind of broke.",0,Come on. It's on me.,0
3746,"who is your favorite NBA star? Kobe Bryant, of course. Kobe? I know him, the key guy of the Lakers, a heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense. He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.",0,Maybe he is not good ay rebounding?,0
3747,"indeed, no man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit. Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA? who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him. well then, what are your spoils?",0,"well, nothing more than a jumble of photographs.",0
3748,"Can I help you? Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine? Yes, but it's checked out. What a pity! I missed it again.",5,It's popular you know. You want to reserve it?,0
3749,"Yes, please. Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book. Thank you. What shall I do when I check out these books? Take the card, and fill in your name and library card number.",0,Thank you so much.,4
3750,What do you like to do with your free time? Study English. You mean you like to study English? Why? It gives me great satisfaction.,0,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work.,0
3751,"Mary? Are you still there? Yes. What do you want? Did your bid win? What do you care, dork?",0,"Hey! I'm trying to be nice, and you still want to fight! Did you get the statue or not?",0
3752,The final examination will be held at the end of this month. Have you made good preparation? Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year. Are you sure you can do well this year? I am 100 % certain.,4,"According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.",0

3754,"Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices! Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite? I love anything with chocolate the best. I like chocolate myself.",4,Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?,0
3755,I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. I haven't ever cared for that myself. Have you ever had garlic ice cream? That sounds absolutely disgusting!,2,"It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.",0
3756,"Hi Colin. How are you feeling today? Oh, I feel ok but I’ m still very tired. It's probably jet lag. I think so. One minute I feel quite awake, and the next I feel very tired.",0,Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city?,4
3757,"Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long It’ s a skill. What can I say? I don’ t know why, I just have a long routine. Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’ s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you’ re out the door. Half an hour, tops. Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’ t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’ s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ ll put my hair up, butoften times I bloody it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’ s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.",0,"True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?",0
3758,"How do you do. I’ m Mark Rancor. Nice to meet you. May I know your name, please? I’ m Rose Teller. I think I’ Ve seen you somewhere before?",0,"Ah, yes. I remember now.Were you Mr. John’ s dinner partner last month?",0
3759,"Yes, I was.You work for 3M, right? I did but now I’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you? Good. May I know what you do?",0,"I’ m a fashion designer.Next month, I have a fashion show. I’ d love it if come. I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like.",0
3760,"You like Titanic? That movie is so cheesy. It's not cheesy! It's romantic. When it first came out, I saw it in the theaters five times in one week. Really? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997, but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy. Alright, maybe it's a little bit cheesy. But come on, isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while?",0,"Actually, I have to admit that you're right. I like some pretty cheesy movies too. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, especially "" Terminator. """,0
3761,"I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car. Yes. I am very interested in the Olympic Games, and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics. Me, too. I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics. That's cool. Care for a little quiz on that?",4,No problem. I'm an ' Olympic expert '.,0
3762,"Wow, you've talked the talk. Now it's time to walk the walk. Here we go. First, can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics? The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece. Good. Why do people name it Olympics? They name it after the place where it was first held.",0,Who started the modern Olympics?,0
3763,This question is a piece of cake. A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin. What did people call him? Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics '. What did he do for restoring the Olympics?,0,He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics '.,0
3764,"I really should be on my way. Oh, don’ t go yet. Let’ s at least have one more. No, thank you. I can’ t. It’ s too bad that you have to leave so early.",0,Thank you very much. I had a really good time.,4
3765,"Thanks for coming! We should meet again sometime soon. That would be great! Actually, can I get your phone number, Ella? That’ s assuming you don’ t mind if I call you sometime. Anytime. You can reach me 5558929. ok, got it. I’ ll call you sometime next week.",4,Fine.,4
3766,"May, could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today? Sure, no problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester. I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class. I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class.",0,"Yeah, my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.",0
3767,"Fortunately her class is just an elective course, not as important as compulsory courses. Right, so we must spare some time to attend selective courses. But isn't it too impolite to be absent? What can I do? I have things to do in Students ' Government.",0,"Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note.",0
3768,"Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record. Yeah, besides, your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious.

3783,"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time? What? Why do we have to do that? Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth.

I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!",1,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time.

I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply. That is true. I’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities. First of all, you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work, three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence, and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It’ s usually 550 ).

3863,"That’ s fine. I’ m going to need you to fill out the application. All right. All done. All right, now please sign the back of the card.",0,Okay. I’ Ve signed it.,0
3864,"How's your time spent in the United States? Well, pretty good. I'm glad to hear that. What impressed you most? Well, the cultural differences impressed me most.",0,You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans?,0
3865,"That's right, quite different. One day one of my American friend looked pale, so I asked him whether he was sick or not. But he was reluctant to answer my question. That's weird. And what's more, when he told me he had caught a cold for several days, I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible. You really cared about your friend.",0,Sure I am. But he responded by saying'what do you mean? '.,0
3866,"It's time to leave the office for the night. Firstly I log off my computer, then I set the electronic security system. That's pretty advanced. Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement. Is that where you park?",0,"Yes, the car park is under constant video surveillance, so my car is quite safe. Please get in.",0
3867,"Thank you. Where is your key? There's no need, I have keyless entry, and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car. Now, we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home. That's amazing, it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment. Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home. Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out.",0,Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves.,4
3868,"Have any plans for the weekend, Tom? Yeah, I’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains. Oh, do you go hiking often? I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.",0,It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?,0
3869,"Sure. But, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before? Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike. Wow!

3874,"Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival? I find it also very interesting. OK. It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband. She is always expecting to see her husband again. So, later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon, it is time for the family members to come together. So, I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day. You are right. In China, ' round ' is an auspicious word. The moon cakes are in round shape.",0,Is it official?,0
3875,"Good morning, Miss. Morning. Can I help you? Yes, I'd like to know how to use the library. You know, I'm a new student here. All you need is your student identification card to check out books.",0,Yes.Here ' s my identification.,0

I resent that!",6,"Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone, you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol!",1
3880,"Have you heard about Anlesen David? No, have they have another fight? No, they got engaged. You must be joking. Those two?",6,"Well, my dear. I didn't believe either. But got it straight form the horse's mouth. David called me this morning.",0

3886,"My goodness! You’ re kidding! No. I’ m serious. I’ m going to quit my job. That’ s amazing! You got a good pay here, didn’ t you? It’ s true. But I can’ t show my abilities.",0,Come on! Don’ t be silly!,0
3887,"I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots. It was me. I am so sorry. What did you think you were doing? I had to move it, so that I can get my bike through.",0,How dare you be so inconsiderate? That's wrong.,1

3889,"What's the movie about? I'm not sure. Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about? I already told you, because Julia Roberts is in it.

Can you show me where I can find them? Yes, just over there to your right. Thank you very much.",4,You’ re welcome.,4
3892,That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful. Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras. I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price. Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions.,4,Such as?,4
3893,"They offer clearer and sharper images. Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses, a photo mode and fast-action mode. They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand. Right! Anyway, the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital. What does this mean?",4,"This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home, like your digital TV or your computer.",4
3894,"I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing. Sure! And without any conversion process or loss of quality!

3897,"So, Monica, what do you feel like doing this afternoon? Actually, I had a perfect plan for this afternoon, but it is totally ruined by the sand storm. I woke up this morning and found it was sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me. We were going to look for a new purse. Now it turned out to be like this. Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore. That’ s too bad. I hate sand storms too. It can be worse than any kind of bad weather. What’ s wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can’ t people do something to stop it?",2,"It is not an easy job. The government is working on it. Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital. Also, methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought. But of course, it will not work overnight. So, have you come out with a new plan for today?",0
3898,May I help you? I would like to return this book. May I do anything else for you? I would also like to check out this magazine.,0,I can’ t let you do that.,0

3903,I just started working out. Really? Where do you work out at? I joined the Samsung Health Club last month. What do you mostly do during your workout?,0,"I concentrate mostly on my legs, chest, arms and stomach.",0
3904,"I should start exercising more. It's hard work while exercising, but it is a great feeling when I get done. I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, but I already got sick of it. Exercising at home is hard. The environment is not suited for exercising.",0,"If I want to exercise, I will need to join a gym.",0
3905,I have a couple of guest passes. You want to check out my health club? That's a good idea. Let's go over the weekend. Great. I'll call you Saturday morning. Aright. I'll talk to you later.,4,Ok. Bye.,4
3906,Is there anything wrong? I’ m worried about my daughter. She can’ t decide about college. Don’ t worry. That’ s just a part of being a teenager. I don’ t mind that.

3908,"Brad, wait! What? How come you have a locker but I don't? Mr. Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you.",0,I had to carry my backpack with me all day.,0
3909,"You didn't tell me she was married! I tried. You were preoccupied. I got carried away. I made such a fool of myself. They were both laughing at me! You got drunk, and you were hilarious. Lighten up.",0,That guy was definitely a Don.,0
3910,"Who is this on the water buffalo? That's my grand-father. He was a farmer. When he was young, he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field. Oh yes, that was the best job in most farm families. That's where many of them learned to play the flute. My grandfather did that too. He used the time to study instead.",0,That's interesting. Go on!,4
3911,"My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school. So he became a self-taught man? Right. Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village. When he was middle aged, he became a great man, quite famous. In what field?",0,As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country.,0
3912,"I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job. Why are you considering trying for it? I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it. What is it about this job that appeals to you?",0,I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.,0
3913,"Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider. I am also wondering about the pay. Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?

3916,"Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, and the kinds have changed often. Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s Gangster movies. Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it. Mm. What came after that?",4,"After all that violence, people needed to laugh, so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s, many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made. Then came musicals.",4
3917,"Pretty good. Please continue. Right. By the mid - 50 ' s, this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects.

3919,"Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising? Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward. That’ s great! I’ Ve heard people say that before.

3920,"Alice, your father is amazing. He’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. I know. He doesn’ t like to ask anyone for help.

It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.",0,They see their independence as a kind of character strength.,0
3921,"This little wooden stick is called a tee. What do you do with it? For the first drive, put the golf ball on the tee, and push the tee into the ground. Okay.",4,"Pick up a wood and hold it like this, interlocking your fingers.",4

Either they go to a public place such as a hotel, a restaurant, or a club, or to the home of the brid",0,They go to the home of the bride?,0
3926,"Why do you ask? The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite. Oh!

It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep. Didn't you bring his favorite toy? Yes, we did.

You know, as a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere. You are right.

Well, if you're in love, maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all. That's what I do.",4,And you think about her all the time?,4
3948,"Yes. And maybe you suddenly have new interests. I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid. For instance, you used to sleep in every morning, but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging. That's it. She likes dogs so much now, and I begin to love dogs. Oh, congratulations. Sounds like you've found your soul mate.",4,"Thanks, but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another.",4
3949,"What book is that? I just bought a new atlas. I’ m looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That’ s a vast country. Canada, China, and the USA are huge too. There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.",0,"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, but compared to many countries in other continents, it’ s not very large at all.",0
3950,How about a movie tonight? It doesn’ t matter to me. Does 7 o'clock suit you? Either way. I don’ t care.,0,How about a snack after work?,0
3951,I couldn’ t careless. Would you rather stay home? Whatever you say. Are you really interested in doing something?,0,I don’ t mind if you want to.,0

3953,"I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year. What a great idea! January would be a good month for a mountain retreat. I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January.",4,"You know, now that I think about it, you might be right.",4
3954,"April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements. That is a good suggestion. We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them. Yeah, that would let us know what would work best.",4,I'll put the survey online this afternoon.,4

3957,We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? No idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights. What else is there to see? What about a factory tour? You mean visit a factory?,0,Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.,4
3958,"Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour. Really? What do the companies do that for? I believe most of them think it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.",4,"Oh, ISEE. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors.",4
3959,I just had a terrible week. what a shame! I fell down and hurt my arm. That's too bad.,0,Then my son drove into a tree.,0

3965,"Okay, let's begin. Hello, everyone. My name's Karl Roberts, and I'll be your teacher for this class, Intercultural Communication. ( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying. Uh, to begin with, please take a look at the syllabus in front of you. As you all should know by now, this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50. That's terrible. He speaks too fast. How can I catch his meaning?",0,"Again, as you see on your course outline, grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, periodic quizzes, and classroom participation.",0

By the way, did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently?",0
3967,"Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago. They did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government. Dying can be very expensive nowadays! What’ s he going to do with it? He said that he would probably invest most of it. He’ s got a well-paid job, so he doesn’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.",0,I had some good financial news yesterday too.,0
3968,"Julia, I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning. I know them. They are the two brothers living next door. Brothers? Do you know why they quarreled?

3970,"Yes. I never stay out that late. That's too late. But why is it too late? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow. Why not stay out and drink with us?

3972,"Don't worry about it. It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested, and they have a little pot in their possession, they don't go to jail. They just have to pay a fine. Really? Yes. I didn't know you had such wild friends. Do you smoke marijuana too?",0,"I tried it a couple times. But I don't like it. I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them, though. If you don't want to smoke pot, you don't have to.",0
3973,"I don't want to. That's alright. But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon. I don't know if I can drink more. I already had two drinks.

3975,"She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, but the whole time all I could think was "" what's wrong with your voice? "" Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to. I doubt it. Last time was an oral train wreck. Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil. Oh come on, it's not that bad.",0,"No, it's so much worse. And tonight they invited me out to dinner. I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off.",0
3976,"Hey. Why did you take that money? You are such a cheater! I should send you to jail! I am not cheating. When you pass go, you collect $ 200, Everyone knows that! Well you can’ t just take the money. You have to ask the bank for money. And I’ m the banker. Banker?",0,Yes...,0

3978,"David, do you think which team will get the champion tonight? It is hard to guess now. Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time. I guess the game will end in a tie. They are equally matched. I am so nervous now. What a terrific game! Which side are you on?",4,"It's hard to say, because each team has my idols.",4
3979,"There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester. Yeah, so what do you think about the teachers? To be honest, I like all of them, except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seems like an old person. He's so boring. I think so too. I don't like him either. Well, who do you like best?",0,It might be the English teacher. What about you?,0
3980,"Me, too. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her. She is a pretty good teacher! With her help I think I can make great progress in English. Yeah, I like her way of teaching. She told us not to cram for exams, and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing. I think it's a good way to develop our language ability.",4,"Actually, our new math teacher is a good person. He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us.",4
3981,Can you recommend a resort to me? What about the Yellowstone National Park? Have you ever been there? Yes. The scenery is so breathtaking.,4,What is especially impressive?,0

You can be the white ones and I’ ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.",0
3984,"What about all these other pieces? See this one that looks like a tower? It’ s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’ s a very important piece so it’ s best to not let your opponent capture it. And these two? They are husband and wife? That’ s right! That’ s the queen and that’ s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say Check Mate and the game is over! Doesn’ t this sound fun?",0,Nah! This is boring! I’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!,0
3985,"Hello, Elitherbeth How are you? Fine, thanks. Are you sure you’ re alright. You look a bit worry today? Is anything wrong? Well, Yes. There are something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.",0,of course if I can.,0

We’ d better have breakfast now. and meet him later.",0
3988,"Well, it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies. Maybe we're just different kinds of people. Yeah it's too bad... but actually I think I know what to do. What's that?

3989,"Jared, I just heard about your father. How is he doing? He's in the hospital resting. The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet. I'm so sorry to hear that. But this is a good hospital.

4001,"Sorry, that's too late. I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM. OK, how about 1:30 PM? No, that's too early. I'll still be at work then. How about 5:00 PM?",4,That's fine.,4
4002,Have you been to Shanghai before? Yes I have. I’ Ve been there three times in the past year. That sounds great. Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower? No I haven’ t.

4025,"I see. I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified. You just said your English needs work, yes? Yes, that's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes. Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.",0,You mean you and I?,0
4026,"Yes, why not? I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English. That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it? Let's see... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange. How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?",0,"First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want, I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.",0
4027,"Would I help you with writing? No. For me right now, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice.

Now that I have a wife and a child to support, we hardly have enough money for food and rent.",0
4030,"there are trying times for everyone. What do you propose? I could really use a 5 % rise. that's quite a bit. If I give you a raise, I'm going to have to give everyone a raise. listen, if you give me a raise, I'll take on extra responsibilities.",0,"that sounds reasonable. How about this, from now on, you can be responsible for scheduling. That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift, then you'll have to do it.",0
4031,"David, I’ m going to China. Really? How do you get the chance? You know. I took part in the Chinese contest. I was the best and they gave me this reward. I don’ t have to pay for my trip. Congratulations. How lucky you are!",4,Thank you. I’ m leaving tomorrow morning.,4

4037,"Of course I am. I only love you, Amy. Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you. Why do you always accuse me like that? Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all.",4,"Oh, Amy. I am the luckiest guy in the world.",4

Besides, he's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, too. Get out of here! I'm dead serious.

Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says? you know she probably feels just as bad.",0,"well, I think I was being a little selfish myself.

I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes.

4078,"Jack, what's wrong? You! What are you talking about? What did I do? You told Martha that I was on a date? What was that all about?",1,No... that's not what I meant. I didn't mean that.

4079,"She started feeling suspicious after you said that. I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up.

Yes, I have seen those signs.",0,The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?,0
4084,"There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms. What are those? They are the things that make up the atom, such as electrons and protons.

Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens. The engine won’ t start. Should I maybe press the accelerator? No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.",0,So what do you think it is?,0
4088,"Do you have a copy of today’ s newspaper? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship. Yes, I ‘ m just reading them myself. It’ s been a great competition.

We won the men’ s high jump and the women’ s 1500 meters.",0,That’ s great. Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition. They must be terribly disappointed if they don’ t win.,4
4089,"The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds. That’ s amazing! Were any other records broken? A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters. Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump, but it only got him third place. Did you see the final of the men’ s 100 metres? It was very exciting. One competitor made two false starts.",0,Was he disqualified?,0

4095,have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort? not yet. I think you should do that soon. It will help you make a decision about the school you go to. that's a good idea.,4,good luck!,4

4098,"There are so many environment problems in the world today. Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world? I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action, but I doubt it’ ll happen before it’ s too late.

I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here. you are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk. There's a grocery store, a book store, a gym, and many restaurants there's a gym nearby? That's exciting!

Did your boss say something to offend you at work? He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment. Don’ t you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn’ t be so bad...",0,"You’ re missing the point. It’ s about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It’ s his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words.",2
4102,"Is your lady beautiful? Since I came here from the country, I've not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?

Afterward, we will make New Year calls on family relatives, husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second. Do you bring some gifts along? That's for sure. Fruit, cream cakes, medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives, and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids. All this, of course, should be well prepared beforehand. Is it the same practice for all families?",0,"Not all the same nowadays I must say. Many families, especially those of newly married couples, choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines.

You know, I’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg. I don’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’ t know if you’ re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently.

I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers. That's the whole point. All your inhibitions disappear because you can’ t see the other person. This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn’ t talk to. I just want a private conversation with one other person.,0,"You can do that.

OK, go on.",0,"After being raised together, men and women can be business-like in each other’ s company.

I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert, painting, handwriting, reading novels and reading fashion magazines. What about yours?",0
4127,"I have fewer hobbies than yours. That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting. Oh, you can't think like that. We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas. You like taking photos and going to photography shows, why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable?

I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway... now that I'm going to have to make some claims, I think I'd better try and understand how the system works. Would you mind breaking it down for me? Sure. Basically we have two insurance policies for employees... workman's compensation and medical insurance. The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation, and for a significant part of the medical coverage, but you pay part of that premium, too. That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month, right?",0,"Yep. Every country in the world has a different system, but here we buy insurance from a private provider.",0

You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It’ s not like you can just light up like before.",1
4220,"What's wrong, Dave? You look down today. I didn't pass the English exam. How to learn English well? Can you give me some suggestions? Well, English is a "" paper tiger "". Its natural enemy is adequate practice. I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises, and I also spend much time in memorizing English words.",5,"I suggest you read English texts aloud every day, and try to speak more. That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language.",0
4221,"I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to find a job. If I don't, I won't be able to stay here next semester. Have you tried university part-time jobs? What do you mean? I mean in the library, or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions.",0,"Yes, I know. I tried that.They don't have anything now. So what can I do?",0
4222,"Well, since you're a foreign student, it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America. I know that. You don't have to tell me that. That's my problem. I know I have the right to work for the university. That's legal.But they don't have a job for me. And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere. Anyway, there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York. But I need a pretty decent job. I need to make enough to pay my rent at least.",0,I have an idea.,0
4223,"What? Since you're Chinese, maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown. I already had that idea. Well, why don't you go and look down there?",0,But I don't know what I would do.,0
4224,"Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you? I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best? I would like to come in at three o'clock. I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office?",0,"Yes, I can.",0
4225,"Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor. I got it. If you do get lost, just ask someone in the building to point the way. Thank you, I'll be there.",0,"If you need to cancel your appointment, please give me a call!",0
4226,"At what age do children start school in your country? At five. Do boys and girls go to school together? Yes, they do.",0,Do you think this is a good idea?,0
4227,"Yes, I do. Do some children go on to university? Yes, they do. What examinations do they take first?",0,O levels and A levels.,0
4228,"Are you okay, man? You don’ t look very well. Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor, and things got a little out of hand. Nice! So, where did you guys go? We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!",0,Oh no! Mike’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure!,0
4229,Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar! Is that why you missed work today? Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times. Www!,0,"I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water, and my head has been pounding all day. I swear, I’ m never gonna drink again!",0
4230,"Hey Claire, you've been really quiet these last few days. Is something wrong? I've been really stressed. It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do! I feel like I'm drowning in work. Well, stress is a real thing. It's not an imaginary condition. It's seriously affecting my life! I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay... why am I so weak?",0,"You're not weak... you're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators... and as you might imagine, that was pretty stressful.",0
4231,"Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork! But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors! It's called the flight or fight response. Each time you feel like something's threatening you, your body decides whether to run away or fight... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body. So a deadline will cause that same reaction? It could. Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did. They just had a couple of close calls every day, but today, we have dozens or even hundreds!",0,So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life?,0
4232,"Hey, Mary, what's up? Not much. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight. Oh, that's exciting. What's this guy like? Is he hot? Well, I ddin't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have so much in common. We like the same teams, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.",4,It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?,4
4233,"When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill, what do you do to attract his attention? I just make eye contact with him and nod my head. Then I tell him when he comes over to the table. Why do you ask? I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill. That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant.",0,"That’ s what I thought. I just thought I’ d ask you and see what you thought of it. Anyway, what did you do yesterday evening?",0
4234,"Well, it was a warm evening, so I stretched my legs. I walked along the canal for a couple of miles. Actually, several other people had the same idea. I saw Bill. Did you? How is he these days? He seemed ok. We didn’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal. We just waved at each other. I need to move some furniture. Could you help me to lift it?",0,Of course. What do you want to move first?,4
4235,"Excuse me, Miss. Yes. May I help you? I'm a graduate student here in mathematics. I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before. I'll be here for five years, so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible. I wonder if someone might have time to show me around. I'd be very glad to show you around, but I'm very busy right now. Could you come back about 3 thirty?",0,Sure. 3 thirty this afternoon.,0
4236,"Don't open any of my forwards! I got a virus! Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus. I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world. Yes, that's exactly the bug I got. Though, I do kind of like the pictures. Those clothes do suit him better.",0,Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted?,0
4237,"I need some flowers for my girlfriend. No problem. Would you like some artificial carnations? Oh, no. Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion. How much did you want to spend?",0,Money is no object.,0
4238,Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily. I will take ten. Do you want to add some baby’ s breath for that? They are equally popular now. Of course. Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon?,0,"Yes, but there is a five dollars delivery charge.",0
4239,"Julie, what's on the tube? nothing but bench of commercials. These days the amount of commercials is amazing. yeah. Maybe we can change to another channel. what about the sports channel? Let's see if there's a game on. okay. Nope, it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain.",0,"it was a good game, but not good enough to watch again. Keep surfing.",0
4240,"alright. Hmm, this movie is a rerun... I don't know how many times I've seen this show... Commercial again... and a replay of the talk show... oh no, this show is terrible, you don't wanna watch it. oh, what is it? it's a total rip-off of an American reality show, but the imitation is unbearably clumsy. oh, I know this kind of shows. Sometimes they really piss me off. If I wanted reality, I'd go outside.",0,"yeah... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats, or commercials, or low-quality shows. There's really nothing to watch.",0
4241,"Did you go to the bank to withdraw money? Today is so hot, besides I had so much housework to do. My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours. I didn’ t forget, but I had no time at all. So you didn’ t. Is that right? Yes. I’ m sorry.",0,Why didn’ t you just answer my question directly? Why would Chinese answer questions this way? I simply asked if you did it or not. It’ s a very simple question. And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer.,1
4242,"Did you tip the bellboy? Yes, but I don’ t think it was enough. He looked disappointed. I gave him three dollars. That sounds about right to me, fifty cents a bag. If they think you don’ t know better, they’ ll try to get more. It’ s the same in Balloon. But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver. The fare was twenty dollars, and you gave him a five-dollar tip. That’ s twenty-five percent of the total! Too much!",6,"I disagree. He was polite and informative, and he drove smoothly. One should reward good service.",0
4243,"Mom, what are you doing? I'm clipping coupons. Still clipping coupons? It's a good way to save money.",0,Saving money? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons?,0
4244,"Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say? Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery? Let’ s see... If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world. If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!",0,My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!,0
4245,"Wow, there are so many lanterns to appreciate. Now. you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival. Yes, it deserves its name. Did you notice the characters on the lanterns?",0,Sure. But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters. What do they say?,0
4246,Do you have s second? Sure. What do you want? I want to tell you I've put in my notice. Really? Why?,6,"I've been thinking about this for several months, well before the Spring Festival holidays.",0
4247,"Hi Joe. You met my new assistant, right? Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. You are kidding, but she's so helpful. Tom... you are her boss, you down. Of course, she's helpful to you.",0,Come on. She's like that with everyone.,0
4248,"So, John, what do you do for a living? I’ m a sales manager in a publishing company. Oh, really? That sounds interesting, what kinds of book do you publish? Oh, mostly fiction, lots of romance, science fiction, biography, stuff like that.",0,"Oh, What a cool job! How long have you worked there?",0
4249,"Dad, you keep talking about family in New Zealand. Who are they? Well, that's your uncle Bill, his wife and two of their daughters. Is uncle Bill your brother? No, your uncle Jack is my brother, Bill is my brother-in-law, your mom's brother.",0,So his two daughters are my cousins?,0
4250,"That's right, Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters. What are step-sisters? Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter. When she was young, Bill's first wife, Sarah's mom died. Three years later Bill married again. So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother. Right?",0,Yes. She is Sarah's step-mother.,0
4251,"I'll help you, Lucy. Look at what I've got here. In this small bottle, there's a magic love potion. A magic love potion? Yes. If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep, he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up. It can't be true.",4,Take my word for it.,4
4252,"All right, let's see who's ruining my TV time. What are you going to do? Call my boss and chew him out? Is your boss named Vic? Your pager says, This is Vic. Here I come! Impossible. My pager is really old. It doesn't display messages.",0,"Here, see for yourself. That's really strange! It's almost the same as when I...",0
4253,"Don't talk too much, Tom. We are on duty today, we should hurry up. OK. Tom, your task is to clean the blackboard. How about yourself?",0,I'm going to sweep the floor first.,0
4254,"Daniel, I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard. Stand on the chair, Pig Tom. Use your brain. OK, I've finished cleaning the blackboard. How about the podium?",0,"Oh, I forgot about it. I'll get it.",0
4255,"Jim, I heard you took a trip to San Diego. Is that right? Yeah, I just got back this morning. That sounds really nice. What did you do there? Well, we were only there for three days, so we didn't do too much. We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. And at night we walked around the city with some friends.",4,Did you take any pictures?,4
4256,"Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them? Sure, I love looking at photos. This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife. Your daughter looks like her mother.",4,"I know, they look very similar.",4
4257,"Where was this picture taken? That was taken at the train station before we left. Did you have time to go to the zoo? No, not this time. We went there last time.",4,It looks like you all had a nice time.,4
4258,"Are you interested in history? Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks. I love history, but I’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened. I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks!",0,Some people say that history repeats itself.,0
4259,"Nice day today, isn't it? Yes, beautiful weather we're having. We can't complain about the weather recently. Yes, the sun shines day after day. It's neither too hot nor too cold.",4,I wonder how long this weather can last.,4
4260,"Excuse me, Sir, May I have the time, please? Beg your pardon? Er... I'd like to know what time it is now. Oh, Let me see... It's three forty-five. Er... wait, My watch is five minutes fast. So it should be three forty",0,"Thank you. By the way, what day is today?",0
4261,"Today is Friday. Are you new in Beijing? Yes, I've just come from the States, yesterday in fact. I'm still a bit confused about the time. Welcome to Beijing. This is my business card. I'm an engineer. If you need any help in Beijing, just give me a call. Oh, that's very nice of you. I don't want to sound pushy, but I still l have one more question.",4,Go ahead.,0
4262,"I really enjoyed that film! What about you? So did I. At first, I thought it was going to be boring, but then it turned to be good. What part of the film do you like best? Well, the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most.",4,"I loved it, too. To tell you the truth, I even dropped tears.",4
4263,I just got a letter from an old high school buddy. Really? That's nice. He usually keeps me posted. I've been completely out of touch with my old friends.,0,It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much.,0
4264,"What did you think of the film? I liked it. I thought it was great. Yes, I liked it, too. Did you like the acting? Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?",4,Not really. I thought it was disappointing.,2
4265,"Do you know something about Mount Tai? Yes. But not too much. It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China. Five sacred mountains? Why people call them so? Because in history, the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation.",0,Got it. Can we see any things left by them?,0
4266,"Mary, this is your homeroom. It's 213. Remember that. What's a homeroom? You sit in there, listen to the morning announcement with other kids, and then you go to your classes. Cindy, I'm scared.",3,But I have to go to my homeroom.,0
4267,"Helen, you must be excited at going to America to study. Yeah, I've been looking forward to it for ages. What do your classmates think of it? They give me a lot of congratulations.",4,How long will you study there.,0
4268,"Oh, maybe three years. I will study and get the master degree first. Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back. Which university will you go to? Chicago University. My major is Economics. Good luck!",4,Thank you!,4
4269,"Look! Someone is celebrating his birthday. This must be his 21st birthday. No doubt about it. Why? Do you know that guy? No. Well, in America, 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink. So, many guys celebrate it in bars.",0,"That's interesting. But it would be really expensive, I suppose. Just think about all the drinks.",0
4270,"have you adapted to the lifestyle in China? yeah, almost. But there is one thing. what? I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but...",0,what is it?,0
4271,some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others. that makes you feel uncomfortable? yeah. we never do that in a public office. perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.,0,"i have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.",0
4272,"Excuse me, Miss. Yes. May I help you? I'm a graduate student here in mathematics. I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before.

4273,"what's your apartment like? it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus. what is it like living in on-campus housing? it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The freshmen that live nearby are really loud, especially on the weekends. But, the rent is much cheaper than private housing, so it's worth it.",0,did you have to pay a deposit?,0
4274,"no, but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months, so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month. do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent? no, it's all included. Besides, students don't have to pay council tax, so we're saving quite bit of money by living here. how long is your contract for?",0,"that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June, so we'll have to find a new apartment soon.",0
4275,"You should have seen the T. V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting, animal rights. Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights. Yes, but we can’ t deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings. I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren’ t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.",0,"You can’ t compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can’ t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.",0
4276,"Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear. Yeah... hearts, stars and some weird looking things. Those are money bags, and they represent your financial situation. So decode this for me, Madame Psycho.",0,That's Madame Psychic to you.,0
4277,"Mary, how was your date with john? it's ok. It seems we have a lot in common. oh, really. That is great news. What does he look like? he is tall and slim, fair-haired.",4,sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?,0

4279,"What should I take first? That chair over there, but please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law. Don't worry, I won't drop it. Wow, it's really heavy. I don't think I can move it by myself. Let me help you with that. I don't want you to hurt your back.",0,Where are you taking all this stuff?,0
4280,"Have you received your TOWEL test results yet? Yes, I did. I passed! Congratulations! I knew you could do it. Well, I certainly couldn't have done it without your help. You are the best tutor I've ever had.",4,"Thank you, but it was your hard work that did it.",4
4281,You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened? I had to look after my son at home. What's wrong with him? He has a fever.,0,Is he getting better now?,0
4282,"how's it going? I'm in a good mood today, actually. How about you? to be honest, I'm a bit fed up. what's wrong?",0,there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around.,0
4283,"I see! Do you want to ask her out? sure, but how? you can ask her out for drink after work. but for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.",0,then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.,0
4284,easier said than done. you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her. but I always get tongue-tied when I see her. that's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased.,0,I see. I'll try.,0
4285,"Lisa, would you like to go to the library with me? OK. Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first? Sure. First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library. Are we going to walk or drive?",4,The weather is really nice today. Let's walk.,4
4286,"The weather is good now, but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon. Alright, then let's take an umbrella. Is your brother coming with us? No, he's still sleeping. Wow, it's already 10:00 AM. He must have been up late last night.",0,"Yeah, he didn't come home until 12:00 AM.",0
4287,"Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you, what are your tricks? Thank you for saying so. I don’ t know, probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues. Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work. That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.",0,You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.,4
4288,"how was your education going on in Australia? I'm going to graduate this summer. where are you going to work then, in Australia or back in China? I'm planning to return to China after graduation.",0,why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.,0
4289,"well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment. yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country. absolutely, many Chinese enterprises are going global, and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business. the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home.",0,that's right. Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China.,0
4290,"How do you like this dress? It's nice. But what kind of dress are you looking for? Something attractive and dressy. Maybe a little sexy too. New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year, right? Of course. It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year.",0,People here always wear the best clothes they have. Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve.,0
4291,"Any other common customs of your New Year? Before the New Year, we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year. On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year '. It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution. What's that? It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do. Many people resolve to quit smoking, lose weight, or stop nagging their wife, etc. However, it usually lasts only for a few days!",0,"By the way, where are you going on New Year's Eve?",0
4292,"Hey, you wanna see a movie tomorrow? Sounds like a good plan. What do you want to see? How about Legally Blonde. Ah, my girlfriend wanted to see that movie. I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time. How about The Cube?",0,Isn't that a scary movie?,0
4293,Could you help me to register for a class? Do you know what class you want to take? Are there any Psychology classes available? I believe there are still two Psychology classes open.,0,On what days are the classes?,0
4294,There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4. Can you tell me about the other class? It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday. You're positive that these are the only classes left?,0,These two are the only ones.,0
4295,"Lucy, you’ re back. How was your first day of school? It was great. I had a really good time. What classes did you have? Well, I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock, art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock.",0,What do you think about the teachers?,0
4296,"To be honest, I liked all of them, except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seem like an old person. He’ s so boring! That’ s too bad. How was your English teacher? She was great. In today’ s class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to arm for exams, and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing. Where is she from?",0,She said that she’ s from a small town in the middle of America.,0
4297,"Were you able to understand everything that she said? Not everything, but nearly. She speaks very clearly and doesn’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her. She sounds like a good teacher. Do you think you’ ll pass her class? Yes... with flying colors!",4,What does that mean?,0
4298,"It’ s a new phrase that she taught us today. It means that I will not only pass the class, but I will do extremely well! If you like the class this much already, I’ m sure you will. I hope so. did she give you any homework?",0,"not today. She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework,",4

4300,The police need our help finding a robber. How do you know? The TV news is reporting a bank robbery. Do they know what the robber looks like?,0,"Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.",0
4301,What race is he? They didn't say. The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore. Of course not. That would be racist.,0,But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?,0
4302,"David, imagine meeting you here! Janice, I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning. Is that true? All right! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables. I stole your peaches and flowers. It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen. I also got something this morning.",0,How many vegetables do you steal today?,0
4303,"I stole many from Fred's farm, and from yours. I planned to have a dog on farm. So funny. By stealing, I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work. I could not agree with you more.

4307,"She must have been a part-time worker. They didn’ t have much training. Why didn’ t you register then? She said I couldn’ t until I had my birth certificate. Here it is. Huh, that is no reason to demand a birth certificate. We only need to establish residency, you know, a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine. Serious? Only the proof of my address.",6,"Yes, I am afraid she gave you the wrong information.",0
4308,"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? Sorry, I thought you knew. But you should have told me you were in love with her. Didn't I?",0,You know you didn't.,1

But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’ t students want to have a good memory? Of course. I didn’ t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?",0,"Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything.

4395,"How can I lose weight, doctor? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food? Well, Jim. It is a combination of how much you eat, the type of food you eat, and when you eat your meals. I never eat breakfast though. That's a big mistake, you should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, and as well you won't expect your body to work without food.",0,I never thought about it that way.,0
4396,"I am confused. How could a golfer need so many clubs? Seems to me, 14 altogether, right I should say, a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs. Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs? In general, a set of golf clubs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, PW ; Woods : 1, 3, 5 and a putter.",0,So many?,0
4397,"Do you remember John from head office? Yes. Have you heard what happened to him? No, what?",0,He had his car stolen. Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car.,0
4398,"What do you mean? Well, apparently, he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in. Crikey. Where did this happen? In Taichung, I think.",0,"Oh, right, I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there.",0
4399,"Really? Well, anyway, they pointed their guns at him and said, you know, keep calm and drive out.... we don't want to hurt you... we just want your car. So what happened? Well, he drove out, and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant, he pretended to have an epileptic fit, you know, to scare the thieves away. The attendant was no help at all, even though the guys were holding guns in plain view, he did nothing. That's terrible.",0,"Yes, makes you think, doesn't it?",0
4400,"Are you a newcomer? Yeah, this is my first visit here. You speak good English, though. Thanks, but I speak English with a strong German accent.",4,"But let me tell you, you're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, how long have you been learning English?",0
4401,"Do you still see the people we went to school with? I did for a while, I suppose, until I left university, but after that not really.

4402,How are you doing? I'm doing great. What movies have you seen lately? I saw Forrest Gump the other day.,0,What type of movie is that?,0
4403,The movie type is drama. I can't believe you are watching movies. The weather is great. You should be outside. I hate the hot weather. I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner.

4411,"Do you want to go out for dinner tonight? Sure. Have you got anywhere in mind? I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions. That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?",4,"I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.",4
4412,"If you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, they've westernized their food, so it's not actually that spicy. You're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us. The Taj? They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food.",4,The Taj it is then.,4
4413,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money? They'll still charge us a corkage fee. That's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway. Don't worry about money. I'll treat you tonight.,4,Are you sure? We could go Dutch.,6

4420,"So Chris, I've heard that you're from a big family. How many people? Nine total. Seven children and my parents. Seven children? That's a lot. Why did your parents have so many? Well, my mother came from a big family, and wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.",0,"Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.",0
4421,"It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make. Like what? I assume that there's no privacy. That's one. Another is the lack of personal property.

There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.",0,Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.,0

4426,"Do you have any plans for tomorrow? Well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends. You might want to change your plans. With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow, the roads are going to be rather slippery. I suppose I should. I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions. Do you have any plans for tomorrow?",0,I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon.,0
4427,"If you're lucky, it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day! If that happens, then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies. That sounds like fun. Hey, look outside! It's started to drizzle!",4,English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought.,0
4428,"Is there a city where it's always warm? Yes, there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego, for example. Are there any other cities where it's always hot? Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year.",0,But why do so many people live there?,0

Several.Two good examples are Seattle, in the state of Washington, and Portland, Oregon. Tell us about some cold cities.",0,In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them.,0
4430,"Mark, you are not telling me the truth. Now why? Promise you are not going to be angry? Yes, all right. So why? Go on then. Say it. Oh, really, Mark. I promise I'm not going to be angry. Now why were you late? I forgot.",0,You forgot? You...,6

You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office, it will make a bad working environment for everybody. You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic. I've never met anyone as cheery as she is. Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around, but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary, on the other hand, spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also, she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp.",0,"Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker? What about Bob? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green, he is a great co-worker.",0

I’ m pretty sure they’ re the groom’ s niece and nephew.Oh, they look so cute!",4
4435,"Hello everyone, and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation! That’ s right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest. What does that mean?",0,"Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again! That’ s when we have to apply this procedure. Let’ s begin! I need a volunteer.",0
4436,"Me! Me! Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’ s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

I knew Sally would finally show her true colors. When she got her final test results back from Mr. Leo, she started yelling at him. You should have heard her. I’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before. To make a long story short, it seems that Mr. Leo failed her because he caught her cheating.",0

4445,Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school? Really? Why? He had moved and held a party on July 1st. It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time.,0,"Even he's not coming back to school anymore, you still can call him and meet him on weekends.",0

4447,"How long will it take us to drive to London? I think it’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London, so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway. That’ s unless there is a traffic jam. It could take three hours. You’ re right. We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey, because we will be in built-up area.",0,"So, shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?",0
4448,"Ok. You haven’ t seen my company car, have you? No. let me take a look... It’ s longer than my car. I think it’ s over five meters long. I can’ t remember exactly.

4450,"When I booked the room, your staff didn’ t mention this. And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that. Are you quite sure? Yes. Have a look. I see. I had no idea our advertising was so misleading. It is here, but it’ s in the fine print on the last page.",0,Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate.,0

4456,"Which ones? Let me have a look.Wow, look at that! That brings back memories... That? Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trev fountain, and we got caught in the rain... ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

4464,"Do you have much experience with kids? Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson. To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby. I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.",0,What about your mother? Did she help you?,0
4465,"Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’ s it. I had to care for them most of the time. I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day. Don’ t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work. Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.",0,"No. You see, I went back to school to get my Master’ s Degree when I was in my thirties. You won’ t be older than that.",0
4466,"Now I know why I split up with Mike. We found we were simply not good for each other. In what ways? Well, he is a typical Sagittarius guy, while I am a Cancer.

But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune.",0,So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then?,0

When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over. It looks like someone beat you up.

I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account. I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around. I sometimes use traveller's cheques, but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash.",0,Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.,0
5030,"Yes, I do. It saves me a lot of time. I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines. That’ s good idea. You don’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that. I suppose you have a mortgage too. Yes. My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage. There’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays. Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others. I have a deposit account with my bank. There are some restrictions on withdrawing money, but the interest rate is much higher.",0,I don’ t have one. I prefer to buy shares. My bank also provides a share trading service. It’ s cheap and easy to use.,0

5033,Exactly what type of ground beef do you want? Extra lean. I'll get that for you right now. I appreciate that.,4,"Don't mention it, I'll just wrap this up for you.",0
5034,"Excuse me, sir, the toilet in my room doesn't flush. I am sorry, sir. Can you tell me your room number? 812. Is there anything else I can do for you?",0,The tap is always driving. I can't sleep well.,0
5035,"It's so earlier this morning, Mr. Li! You just came back yesterday, you should have rest much more. I'd like to have rest, but I have many things to do. How about this post-trip? It's very good, and the result isn't too bad.",0,Really?,0
5036,"Of course. I will write a report about this post-trip, and then you'd better type it at the moment, OK? OK, it's no problem. ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu. Are you typing my report? Yes, what can I do for you?",0,"Nothing. I just tell you take care of it when you type, especially the address and telephone number of those new guests. You should make sure that it's no mistaken.",0
5037,"I'm pleased to meet you again, Mrs. King. Pleased to see you, too, Mr. Brown. You've had a good trip, I hope. Yes, a very pleasant journey, thank you.",0,It's been a full two years since we last saw each other.,0
5038,"So it is, I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years. We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you. You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement. I'm glad you're satisfied with our work. I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products. Yes, we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos. We can see you are experienced in this particular line.",4,Thank you.,4
5039,"But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative. After all, you sold around 400 pieces there last year. You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end. That is the result of our hard work. Well, what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then? 500 pieces. No, no. That's too big a number to be acceptable. Let's put it at 450 pieces. And we'll strive to sell more, of course. We wish to add another clause. For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota, we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts.",0,"All right, let's fix it at 450 pieces then. And for every additional 50 pianos sold, we'll give you 1 % higher commission.",0
5040,"I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged. We would like to make a specific mention of one more point. As our sole distributor, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own. No, certainly not. That's a reasonable restriction. Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products.",0,"Yes, we've already prepared one. I've brought it with me. I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow.",0
5041,"I think we have had a very pleasant conversation, haven't we? Yes, I think so too. Do you have any other questions? Let me think... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee.",0,I'm sorry we can't now.,0
5042,I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live. Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future. That would work too. Anything else?,0,Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees. Will this company do so?,0

5044,"So, Emily, how was your day? I don't think you really want to hear about it. It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it. To be honest, it was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck!",2,Why? What happened?,0
5045,"Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! That's not very fair. What did you do? There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired me for sure. Does he treat everyone in your department like this?",0,"He treats everyone pretty badly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake!",1
5046,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company? Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.,0,That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders.,0
5047,I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week. What about income? Did you make any money during that period?,0,My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period.,0
5048,"When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income? Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form. What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away. I am not going to show any income from now on then.",0,I wouldn’ t do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements.,0
5049,"Jane! What an enchanting skirt you have on! Thank you! Guess how much it costs. Bright colors, smooth material, exquisite craftsmanship, soft lines... Darling, it looks elegant on you! It can't be any cheap stuff. Something around two hundred, I guess. Your offer is way off the mark. It set me back only sixty-five.",0,"Then you got a windfall! Was sixty-five the original price, or did you get a special discount?",0
5050,"Neither. I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down. How much did she ask for? Three hundred! That's daylight robbery. How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me? Without hesitation, I gave my offer---no more than fifty. She must be fuming with anger at such a bid, wasn't she?",0,"Not at all! She's really been around, and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this. That's the trade. She only demanded a higher bid, saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy. She was lying! Then I inquired, ' May I have it at sixty? ' she waved her head.",0
5051,"Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude. I am Mr. Foster, and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people.

It's small, but fully equipped. The refrigerator is new, and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old.",0,It's nice. So this is the bathroom. And that must be the bedroom.,0
5058,"Yes. And there's a walk-in closet. Is there air conditioning? Yes, there's central air conditioning and heating. The thermostat is in the living room 。 What's the house rent? When is the rent due? And how much security deposit do you require?",0,It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month. We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit. It will be returned to you at the end of your lease.,0
5059,"I think if I’ m going to find a job, I’ ll look over the job board. Well, there’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section. Right, so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning. Did you get a copy of the Herald too?",0,"No, why should I? The Globe’ s help wanted section is the best.",0
5060,"That’ s true, but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn’ t have. Not enough to worry about. Why do I waste the money buying two papers? It's only a couple of dollars more. For that much money you can afford to risk it. I guess you’ re right. I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe.",0,Good idea.,0
5061,"Mary, today a man from an intermediary gave me a call. What did he say? He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet, and could offer me an appropriate job. What kind of intermediary is it?",0,It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses.,0
5062,"What job did he recommend to you? It's on telemarketing. Does he ask you to pay some fees? No, he said the employers will pay for it.",0,Then what do you think about it?,0
5063,"I have a parking ticket to pay for. Did you bring your ticket? Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today. Did you bring your ID?",0,I didn't bring my ID.,0
5064,"You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket. What do you need my ID for? We have to know that this ticket is really yours. All right, I see what you mean.",0,"Next time you come back, bring your ID.",0
5065,"Here's the dress you wanted it to be made. Oh, dear! What's the matter? It's not what I asked for.",0,What's wrong with it?,0
5066,"Can I help you, sir? Yes, please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife. What kind of presents do you want? Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended?",0,"OK. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.",0
5067,"Hey, How did you know I came from America? Just a hunch, sir. How much again? $ 59.95.",0,"That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.",4
5068,"Sorry, sir. Why not? Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife. Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.",0,That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY.,4
5069,"DENY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY? It's $ 60 here. That's very unbelievable. Is it fake? Of course not, sir.",0,"OK, I'll take one.",0
5070,"Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house. To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars. I think that maybe I should accept their offer. You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer.",0,"I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house.",0
5071,"There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try one more offer if you like. I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer. After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer. Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?",0,I don’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.,0
5072,"You heard who won the election, right? Who was elected? McCain won the election. That can’ t be true!",6,"I’ m upset, too.",0
5073,I can’ t believe people voted for him. People must want him as our President. That doesn’ t make any sense. I have more bad news.,0,How could the news get any worse?,0
5074,When could we meet to discuss the project? I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you. I prefer Monday. Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?,0,Either one is OK.,0
5075,"Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, be prepared to do your presentation. I will be prepared to do my presentation.

5078,What reason do you have for missing school? I was sick. How were you sick? I had a stomachache.,0,Did it get any better?,0
5079,I'm still feeling under the weather. Would you like anything for your stomach? I took something earlier. Get better.,4,Thanks a lot.,4
5080,"Do you want some dessert? No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress? Where is our waitress anyway? Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?",0,"I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.",0
5081,Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together. So the bill is $ 36.00. How much do you think we should leave for a tip? My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.,0,"I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.",0

5084,There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet. Will the cords keep it from turning on? It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected. I didn't think of that.,0,Try it and see if it works.,0
5085,"So, how are you feeling today? I’ m pretty tired. I haven’ t been sleeping well. Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep? I have enough time. I just can’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.",0,What time do you usually go to bed?,0
5086,"I don’ t have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired. Have you been under a lot of stress lately? I just lost my job, and I am unsure about being able to find another one. Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed?",0,"I haven’ t ever tried that, but it sounds like a good idea.",0
5087,So how was your interview? I haven't gone to the interview yet. It's tomorrow. I am so nervous. Don't worry. You should do fine. You have the experience. I hope so.,0,"Remember, they want someone who works well with people. You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are.",0

5097,"can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding. sure. What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from? it depends on the price, but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend. that will probably be quite expensive, but the more you pay for the fabric, the longer it'll last and the better it'll look. What color do you want the suit to be?",0,I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit.,0
5098,"brown, huh? Isn't that a bit dull? haven't you heard? Brown is the new black. why don't you just get black? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral, a wedding, a job interview — anything! that may be true, but black is so boring. Anyway, I already have three black suits. I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest.",0,here are two different shades of brown. Which one do you prefer?,0
5099,"What do you think of your personality? I am quite alive and energetic. I am a curious person, and I like to learn new things. Do you think you are introverted or extroverted? I am quite outgoing, I think.",0,How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own?,0
5100,"Ok, I’ Ve got an up-to-day map. Let’ s check the route from here to the airport. Where are we? Oh, here we are. So we drive to the A120 and turn left. No, we turn right. Remember that we are coming from this direction. Oh yes! Sorry! Then we drive to the M11 motorway.",5,How far is that?,0
5101,"It’ s only seven miles. We turn left to join the motorway and drive south. According to the map, we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25.

Then we drive west on the M25. we must be careful to turn in the right direction!",0,"Then we drive on the M25. it turns south. When we reach exit 15, we turn left and go west along the M4.",0

So how many miles is that together? 22 miles to the M25, 33 miles on the M25, and 3 after that. That’ s a total of 58 miles, isn’ t it? It shouldn’ t take us very long to cover that distance. Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way.",0,We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn’ t much traffic. I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there. Being early is much better than being late.,0

I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received absolutely.

5113,"I'm glad we came here. This is really delicious! I was worried you would think it was too far to drive. Well, it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really, I think it's worth it. I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food, you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer.",0,"How do you mean "" suffer ""?",0
5114,"I mean, in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better. Even in the winter? Yes, even in the winter. And even if it takes two hours, huh?",0,Why not? I've been craving good food for three weeks now. I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza!,4

I can see that. This is what is called "" dim sum, "" right? Yes, all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America.",0,"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown, you mostly think of food. Is that right?",0
5116,"Of course. I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment. And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner, after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants. No way! What do you mean?",0,"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner. I already know where we're going to go.",0
5117,"Alright, alright. I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again? No, dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown. Taiwanese style? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style? No, dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan.",0,I wonder if you can cook things this good.,4

It was almost two o’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep. Are you worried about something? Why couldn’ t you sleep?,0,"You know how it is when you’ re in a strange country. Everything is new, and you get tired and nervous sometimes. Then you worry about your family, about conditions back home, about your courses, about your money, about everything. I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind.",0
5127,"Mr. Li, the report has been finished. So fast! Thank you. You're welcome. This is my duty. Anything else? Yes, you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer, and then send those materials to each business worker.",0,"OK, I'll do it right now.",0
5128,"Dad, do you know where Mom is? I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you. She'd better not start crying like she usually does.

5137,"You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products. Through our continuous effort, consumers tend to accept your product. So, there will be a potential market for your product in this area, and would you let us act as your agent? We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city. But according to our record, your annual turnover is not too big, so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency. If that's the case, we can talk about it first. What's your concept of a big amount? I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least.",0,I'm afraid that's too much for us.,0
5138,"We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us. However, our company has the regulation for the agency. All right, we accept the challenge. What about the commission? You know, we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal. I am sorry to say that it's a little higher. Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission. You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs. A 20 % commission will not leave us much.",0,"Our price is worked out according to the costing. A 20 % commission means an increase in our price. So, I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent.",0
5139,"We’ Ve got a lot of work to do now, but take your time over this project. We don’ t want to make any mistakes. Ok. I should have it finished by Friday afternoon. Then I can check those account over the weekend. We need to have them finished by Monday, right? That’ s right. We’ ll finish them just in time. The Macy project can wait for the time being.

Some next week on, we should be in less of a rush.",0,I’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off. Everyone deserves it.,0
5140,Don’ t say that yet. A new project could suddenly appear. That’ s true. Right. I’ m going back to the meeting. It’ s been going on for hours and there’ s no indication that it’ ll end soon.

I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.",0,"Well, OK. But no French kissing!",0

I have a special medical plan, and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor. Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry.",0,"This is ridiculous!

5529,"Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background. I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field. My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts. My major in college was English, and as a result, my writing skills are my major strength. I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used. What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession? Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball. At the same time, I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda. I think communication is probably the next key quality. It really worked well when I talked with each of them, explained my situation, and got their input.",0,Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description?,0

Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome. I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done. What are your strengths and weaknesses?",0,"My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs.

I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any problems since that day. When do you find a job satisfying? My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job. When I first started as a paralegal, I had a lot to learn. But through hard work, advice from some good mentors and continuing education, I have come a long way.

5669,"I think, first of all, I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading, if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper. Meanwhile, bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility. Are you able to operate the telex? Yes, I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information.

She said you invited her to dinner last week.",0,Of course I did. As recognition for a job well done. Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner.,0
5675,"Well, there is no problem there. But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused, and that your motives are personal and not professional. I think she's misinterpreted my intentions. What happens now? Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown. It's quite serious.

I see. Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P? I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit.",0,"To tell you the truth, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import.

It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P. You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit. It makes no great difference to you, but it does to me. Well, Mrs. Wang, you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee. We always require L / C for our exports.

I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat. I figure that if they're homeless, they're probably hungry.",0,that's a good idea. Do they usually accept the food?,0
5724,"almost always. However, sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash. it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now. the cost of living in London is just too high for most people. it's true. The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment.",0,"did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage, let alone pay for food and other living costs?",0
5725,"there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around. If only the housing cost would drop, fewer people would be in financial trouble. added to that is the high unemployment rate right now. something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon. politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class.

Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise, the other, an overseas firm. Most probably, the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment, and sometimes, parts and components, while the Chinese enterprises factory building, labor and other resources to the cooperative production. They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract. I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts, particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China. Not necessarily. It depends on the contract stipulations. They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located, or even in a third country.",0,"I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade. It's a reciprocal business, isn't it?",0
5737,"What are your terms of payment? Our terms are net 30. What if we purchase an increased quantity? Can you give us better terms? You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible.",0,"We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units.",0

And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?",0,"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.",0
6129,"Why? That is because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher. He will have to pay a commission to the realtor. Hmm. It all sounds very complicated. It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time. That's why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome.",0,I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like.,0
6130,"So, got any more ideas for the website? Well, since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes, I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room. But we registered at Macy's.

6775,"Mr. Brown, I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem. I'd like, if possible, to see it settled at this meeting. What is it, Mrs. Wang? It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them. Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?",6,"Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.",0
6776,"Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage. The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing. As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export. I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.",0,"The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.",0
6777,"We've already got in touch with the underwriter. But they have refused to accept any liability. They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage. That's a matter over which we could exercise no control, then. I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement, that is, if you have covered this risk in your coverage. To my regret, we failed to cover contamination. This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us. Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case.",0,"Well, live and learn. It seems we'll have to waive the claim.",0

6893,"Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often? First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’ t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves. I see. What else? We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.",0,"Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’ t seem like a waste of time and money.",0
6894,"Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit. What can I assist you with? My family really needs a car, we live quite far out of the town centre, but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go.

Great, I just hope I qualify! Could you tell me some more? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere?",4,"What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you, who offer the type of car that you need.

He or she will know all the local laws and regulations. That’ s very important. A friend recommended a good law firm to me. We’ ll need someone to hire staff. I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that. I don’ t think we should use an agency, because they won’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ. Have we decide on the location of the branch office?",0,"Yes. We have. We chose the location in the northeast of the city, not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD.",0
6905,Why didn’ t we choose an office in the CBD? The offices there were too expensive. Have we negotiated any contracts yet? Yes.

6915,"I'd believe it. She owns magazines, television shows and she has a huge fan base. you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa. did they mention that in the article? yes, she's not only building the school, but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary.",0,that's really commendable.

Oh, OK. Wow! OK. And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over, you'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese. Wow. That sounds really good.",4,"Mm, it is.",0

Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’ t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’ s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I bloody it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’ s another twenty minutes or so.

7644,I'd like to have internet on my computer. Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get? What are my options? You can either get dial-up or DEL.,0,Which one would you recommend?,0
7645,DEL is the best choice. Why is DEL better? It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line. What exactly does that mean?,0,"Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.",0

7655,Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image. Surely it is. You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him.

7656,Don't move from time to time. It is very impolite and will make you nervous. Proper posture can show your confidence.

Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well.,0,Throughout the interview you should maintain patience.,0
7657,"Hello, Elizabeth. How are you? Fine, thanks. Are you sure you're all right? You look a bit worried today. Is anything wrong? Well, yes, there is something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.",0,"Of course, if I can.",0

You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later.,0

7915,"Last month, we only had 40 hits on our site. Our products and prices are good, but the problem is that no one knows about our website.

While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off! Yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life.

8274,"And then? Well, when the finish is dry, the table is done. It all sounds very complicated. It only sounds complicated. It's really very easy.

This segment of the industry is well developed. Sorry to interrupt, Doris, but can you tell me more about these tour groups, what kind of things they enjoy, and so on? Yes, of course. Most of the time, when they travel, they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide, who usually takes care of everything, for instance, choosing the restaurants, the itinerary, the mode of transport, and things like that. Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend. They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer. They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything. I don’ t mean to interrupt, but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market?",0,"Just a moment. I'll tell you about that in a minute. Where was I? Oh yes.

We’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment.

8358,Can I help you with something? I need to cancel one of my accounts. Is there a problem with it? I don’ t need it anymore.,0,What would you like to do with all the money in this account?,0
8359,Just transfer it over to my remaining account. I can do that. That would be great. Do you want to take any money out?,0,Not today.,0
8360,"Hi, Nancy. How are you doing? Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee? Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up. Oh, hey, did you look in the classified ads?",0,You mean used cars?,0
8361,"No, Ah... single sellers. Well, yeah, but I'd be getting somebody else's problems. Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now. It's the same kind of deal though, you know, you never know what you're going to get.",0,"Oh, hey, how about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.",0

8363,"Good morning, how have you been doing? I haven’ t been able to take a deep breath lately, and I need to know why. Have you had any type of bug lately? No, I’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time. It just is hard to breathe.",0,Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies?,0
8364,"No one has ever checked me for allergies. Does this happen more when you are under stress? When the weather gets really cold, it gets worse. I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma.",0,Thank you for pursuing this. I appreciate your help.,0
8365,"Let's go to Wangfujing by bus. Better take the subway. It's faster, and more convenient. OK, it will be a new experience for me. We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway, especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy.",0,Where do we pay the fare?,0
8366,"Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token. Then, you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in. Let me pay for it. Where can I get a subway map? Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one. It's free fo charge. Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations. Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains?",0,"No, you don't have to. Here comes the train.",0

8371,"Well, Yuri, tell me about it. I'm sorry I can't bring better news, sir. The site is a disaster. That's what I was afraid of. It is not only the earthquake, sir. But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud.",0,Mud? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district. I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango.,6
8372,"That's what we thought, sir. That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too. Right above our site. Oh, that's terrible! What bad luck! I wish we had never come to this country.But, if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries, it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished! I'm sorry, sir. It's not your fault, Yuri.But tell me. When will Ivan be able to get out there?",0,"Well, it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight, I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch.",0

8374,"No, sir. The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting, sir. Are you serious? Fighting? But I didn't hear anything on the news. You know the government controls the press here, sir. They don't want it reported. Oh, this is terrible, Yuri. Terrible! So we can't even assess the damages. How can we do business in this country? Either we're buried under mud, or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No, I can't believe this mess!",5,"I'm sorry, sir.",5
8375,Your dog is really cute. What's his name? His name is Bingo. What kind of dog is he? We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away.,0,"Well, he sure likes to run around a lot. Is he well behaved?",0
8376,"Oh yes, he is. When he was a puppy, he liked to chew my father's shoes, but he's okay now. That sounds like my cat. She likes to scratch the couch with her claws. I didn't know you had a cat. When did you get her? About a year ago actually. You've probably never seen her though.",0,Really? Why is that?,0
8377,You are seemingly upset. What's behind you? Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered. But I have no idea on the registering process. That's not as complicated as you suppose. Is it so easy? I never experienced this. Can you tell me something about it?,0,It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks. And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field.,0
8378,"Hello sir, how can I help you? Yes, I need this prescription please. Let’ s see. Okay, so 50 mg of Prozac, would you prefer this in capsule or tablet? Capsules are fine.",0,"Okay, you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day. Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach, and also, don’ t ever mix it with alcohol!",0
8379,"Yes, I know. It’ s not the first time I’ m taking this! Don’ t worry, I won’ t overdose! Okay, anything else I can get you? Oh, yes, I almost forgot!

8380,"Good coming, sir. Good morning. Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus? Of course not. But I don't know when to get off.",0,Where are you going?,0
8381,"I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company. This is the assembly line. These drawings on the wall are process sheets.

Oh, it's highly efficient.",0,"Yes, since I came to this company, I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development.",0
8382,Sorry. What was that you said? I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven. Where? At the Gate.,0,"When, did you say?",0

8386,Excuse me.My bag was stolen.Will you help me? When did it happen? Just about half an hour ago. Tell me where it happened and how?,0,Yes.It was just when I was walking in the park. I saw some children with a newspaper.,0

8388,"I love eggplant! Unfortunately, it’ s quite expensive in my country, so I don’ t eat it often. Why is it relatively expensive? Because we don’ t grow it much in my country. We import a lot from other countries. I see. We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country. We export a lot of melons, grapes, oranges and lemons. In your country, do you eat corn on the cob? It's very popular in my country.",0,"We eat it in my country too, but I wouldn't say it’ s very popular. Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket.",0
8389,"Do you mind if I ask you a question? If it’ s too personal you can forget it. I don’ t mind at all. You can ask me anything. We’ re friends. Have you got a scholarship, or are you on your own? I have a scholarship from my government for four years. How about you?",0,I have a tuition scholarship from the university. Otherwise I’ m on my own.,0
8390,I am so busy today. Can I help you? I’ m not sure. Perhaps you could do the shopping. I’ ll be glad to help.,4,Or maybe make the beds.,0
8391,"May I help you? Yes, I’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department. I’ m Smith, the manager of Human Resources Department. May I ask your name? My name is Zhang Due.",0,Would you tell me what education background you have?,0
8392,"I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade. My major was International Trade. Do you have any experience in this field? Yes, I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years. OK. Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English?",0,Yes.,0
8393,"Welcome to our factory. I've been looking forward to visiting your factory. Actually, you'll know our products better after the visit. I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along. That'll be most helpful.",0,Maybe we could start with the Design Department. And then we could look at the production line.,0
8394,"Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes? No, Nancy, today I'm here to make a withdrawal. I made a formal request 7 days ago. You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit, right? That's correct. But before I do, I was wondering if you could give me some advice.",0,"Of course, Mr Hayes. That's what I'm here for. What would you like to know?",0
8395,"You would be using mainly English in this job. Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease? Yes, I think I speak English quite fluently. I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English. They say my English is quite good. How many years have you been learning English? Oh, more than ten years. I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher.",0,"Well, perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it.",0
8396,"Hi, I'm Benjamin. Nice to meet you here. You look great. Thank you. Nice to meet you too. I'm John. Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane? No, this is the second time. But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag. Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, but the jet lag still makes me uneasy.",0,"Oh, that's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?",0
8397,"Yes, whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most. All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World. Was it built before the In dynasty? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty. No, before the In dynasty.",0,"Oh, yeah. Thought I am an American, I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well.",0
8398,"Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea. Yeah, many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China, I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them. Do you like the Chinese traditional silk? I heard about it, but I don't have any clothes made from silk.",0,Go and pick some stuff up. The price can always surprise foreign friends.,0
8399,"Hi. What can I get for you? I’ d like a half a pound of ground beef, please. Good choice! Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean. Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts?",0,"No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.",0

8402,I voted this morning. Who was your vote for President? I can’ t tell you that. Why can’ t you tell me?,0,That is private information.,0
8403,"Billy, you don’ t look too well. Maybe you should take the day off school. But Mom! Today we’ re playing football! I love football! You’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever. What’ s that on your arm? I don’ t know. It was there when I woke up this morning.",0,It’ s a rash. I’ d better take you to see the doctor. How did you get that bruise on your leg?,0
8404,"I bashed it against the chair in my room. Does it hurt? A little, but not much. Here. Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down. I’ ll take you to the doctor’ s after breakfast.",0,"If I’ m better this afternoon, can I go to school?",0
8405,"It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job. Susan, why do we need to find a job? We need to work is because we need money to live. We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house. We need money for many different things, and only when we work, we can earn money. And work can also help us feel that we are useful. But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now. Yes, it is really hard. But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally. When you work, you can accumulate a lot of experience. Besides, you need to learn a lot of things while you are working.",0,I've been fed up with study.,2
8406,"Excuse me? Can you do me a favor, please? It's my pleasure, what can I do for you? I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today. What brings you here?",0,I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation.,0
8407,"Where are you staying? I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel. Oh, it's not very far. And as far as I know it is a fancy place. Yes, it is. Do you know where I can get a town map?",0,"We sell them, right here.",0
8408,I called about that ad we saw in the paper. For the construction site manager? That's the one. What happened?,0,You were right. It was from a headhunter. She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract.,0
8409,"Well, no surprise there. No! Not at all. But, I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work. Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them? I'm going there tomorrow.",0,Great. Good luck.,4
8410,"Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer? Yes, and I think I have good news for you. Did they accept the counter-offer? Yes, they accepted your counter-offer, but they want you to pay for the home inspection.",0,How much will that cost?,0
8411,"It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection. Can I choose the home inspector? Yes, you are paying for it, so you get to choose. I would pick the best one. So, when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance?",0,I will call the owners right now. They will be happy to hear the good news.,4
8412,"This is our rock - bottom price, Mr. Li. We can't make any further concessions. If that's the case, there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off. What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great. I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price. How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded?",0,What is your proposal?,0
8413,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept. When I suggested we meet each other half way, I meant it literally. Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible. What would you suggest? The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars. That'll definitely be rock bottom.",0,"That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered. Let's meet each other half way once more, then the gap will be closed and our business completed.",0
8414,"You certainly have a way of talking me into it. All right, let's meet half way again. I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price. We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting. Yes, there's one other point I wish to clear up. What is it?",0,My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U. S. import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently.,0
8415,"Yes, they're right. In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade. I'm glad to hear that. With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties, and in particular, exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts, is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D. C.? Basically speaking, yes, we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D. C. Of course, there are more details to be attended to. We cannot settle it in a few words. Yes, of course. I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it. When do we meet again?",0,How about tomorrow morning at 9?,0
8416,What's wrong with you? I feel so tired. I really recommend you go for a run in the morning. Why? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day.,0,On the contrary! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day.,0
8417,"Welcome! Would you give me a bottle of beer, please? With ice, sir? No, ice will spoil the taste.",0,"Anything else, sir?",0
8418,"Hello, 35.. Is this Ann? Speaking. Ann, this is Sam. Look, Ann. I wanna see you again. How about a drink tonight?",0,I am sorry. I am very tired. I'm going to bed early.,5
8419,"How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles? In total, it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference. Would you like to see the breakdown? Yes, I want to know exactly where the money is going. Give me a detailed report. First we have the airline tickets, which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going, that's t $ 2,000. For our accommodations, we're spending $ 80 a night, per room, for five days. That's another $ 800.",0,"Weren’ t you able to find anything less expensive? We're sharing rooms, right?",0
8420,"I have two people to a room. The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find. With the conference going on that week, all the hotels have inflated their prices, they're making a killing. So far we have $ 2,800, what else? I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses. That totals another $ 800. And for other incidentals, like take fees, and tips, I have estimated about $ 400. Well, that's only $ 4000. Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000? Where is the rest of the money?",0,"That's my buffer... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget, just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry.",0
8421,"Good morning, room reservations. Can I help you? Yes, my name is Peter. I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st. I'd like to make some changes. The reservation should only be to June 20th. A single room from June 18th to 20th. Is that correct? Yes.",0,OK. Do you need a limousine service?,0
8422,"Gosh, another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes, It's no quicker than a bus. That's true. During rush hours, taxis are just as quick as buses. It was silly of me to have taken a taxi. At least, it can free you from the crowd. By the way, do you come from China?",0,"No, from New Zealand, sir. I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there.",0
8423,I have never done this before and don’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house. Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking you should offer? I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more. It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?,0,I hope that the owners aren’ t insulted by that offer.,0
8424,Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer. Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance? It usually doesn’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer. Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready?,0,The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified for your loan.,0
8425,"Is there a swimming pool in this hotel? We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations. What exactly does that mean? Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.",0,That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?,0
8426,"If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations. Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym? To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7a. m. till 10. I'll go down there as soon as I can!",0,I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.,0
8427,"So that will be one teddy, two terry cloth robes, three pairs of satin slippers, and two pairs of pajamas. Does all that come to 10,000 NT? Let me see... yes, 15,880 NT. After the discount, your total comes to 12,704 NT. Here's your free teddy bear, free panties and your card application. Where do I sign?",0,Right here. And write your address. You'll get the card in the mail within a week.,0
8428,"There's someone coming. It took them four minutes to get here. That was pretty fast. Yes, it's fast. But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage. I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning.",0,I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this. Do you know them well?,0
8429,"Not really. Do you know where they're vacationing? I think they went to Mexico, but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip, and they'll see half their house burned. Yes, but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home. Don't you think?",0,"Yes, I suppose. It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping.",0
8430,Can I help you? I'd like to buy a skirt. What style would you prefer? I like one with flowers on its brim.,0,Do you like this one?,0
8431,It seems too short. What about this one? It looks nice. How much is it? 70 yuan.,0,Is there any cheaper one?,0
8432,This one is only 50 yuan. I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now. It is better than this one although this one is cheaper. All right. Here is the money.,0,Thank you. Anything else?,4
8433,"Here is an invitation for you. Oh, thank you. What is the occasion? Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company. Our general manager invites you to a dinner party. Do you think you can manage it? Oh, yes, I'd very much like to go.",4,That is great. Dinner starts at 6,0
8434,your mp3 looks so cool. Where did you get it? I bought it online. really? Do you often shop online? yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.,0,I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?,0
8435,"yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home. sounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier. and you can still go "" window shopping "" just like in a real shopping mall. well, are there any other advantages?",0,"yes, most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",0
8436,I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much. I'm glad you appreciate our folk music. But a live performance is much more interesting. I can't wait anymore. When does the performance start? The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p. m.,0,( After the show ) It's an excellent musical. The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb.,0
8437,"Are you OK? I'm fine. I'm just so touched by the sad story. So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera. Which scene is your favorite? I love them all. But if I had to name one as the best, I would say it's the ending.",0,"What's it about? You know, I couldn't help falling asleep.",0
8438,"Did you? I didn't notice that. But still you should know it, for you have seen it with Laura before. I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her, too. I mean falling asleep. For me, this one is not that attractive. Then I doubt if you like operas at all. Yes. I like Carmen very much. But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one.",0,"OK, then. The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave, with a rose in his hand. When he got there, he saw someone already put a rose on her grave.",0
8439,"Very impressive. And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice. Me, too. There was always a good round of applause every time she sings. Yes, the applause! That was what kept waking me up during the show. And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting, and music. Just amazing!",4,"No doubt, it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show '.",4
8440,"What can I do for you, sir? What have you got this morning? Fruit juice, cakes and refreshments, and everything. I'd like to have a glass of tomato juice, please.",0,"Any cereal, sir?",0

No. But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts. Many of us get very tired of this, and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office.

I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty. is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals.

8857,"Don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat. What are you talking about? We'll split the bill. No, I insist. I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't.

8877,"Certainly. After all, I've been here for two years. It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils. Though, I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table. Yes, table etiquette. There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm in China. Hey, your chopsticks, old silly! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow!

8910,"I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education, because I want a student visa. Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected? I think that they don’ t complete the forms correctly or they don’ t include all the required documents. The embassy is very strict about it. You have to be quite careful. Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities?",0,That’ s simple. Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.,0

9050,"John, do you have a minute? Oh, hi, Leo. Sure, what’ s up? Well, I’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office. But I’ m not in there very often.

9052,"Ok, let’ s go through this one more time. I don’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses! I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine. Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing. So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?",0,"Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.",0

What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated.",4
9056,"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It's too plain on its own. How about this scarf, these earrings, and an anklet? That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.",4,"Thanks. You'd be OK on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",4

9064,"so, tell me about your new house. How is it different to your old one? well, first of all, it’ s much bigger. It has the same number of rooms, but each room is larger.

I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U. S. Dollar.

9208,Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar. Sixty? That's too much. How can that be? I thought it was wrong too. It didn't make sense. Just two days ago it was 35.

I don’ t like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. I don’ t want bows. I find slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally, this is what I’ m looking for.",0,What size?,0

By the middle of October, I think.",0,"That's too late. You see, November is the season for this commodity in our market, and our Customs formalities are rather complicated.",0
9240,"I understand. Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks. Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers. The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season. But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter. Mr. Brown, you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us. If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices, we shall lose out.",0,"I see your point. However, we have done more business this year than any of the previous years. I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery.",0

Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn’ t have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn’ t look into a couple of different HMO’ s.",0,"Yeah, you’ re right. We aren’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.",0
9245,"Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO’ s with low co-pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too. Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money. Well, we don’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine. I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.",0,Not in a million years!,5

9251,"Come here, please. We'd like to wash your hair first. That way it will be easier to cut and style. I think you'll like this style. It's very fashionable. I hope so. I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing. Would you like me to blow-dry your hair? Yes, if you think it will help.",0,What do you think of it?,0

9263,"Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?",0,Not always.

From European suppliers, I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports. It's the general practice. As a rule we don't allow any commission. But if the order is sizable one, we will consider it.

I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know. Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more.

9439,"Mr. Black, when is the earliest shipment you can make? In April or early May. I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us. Our customs formalities are quite complicated, and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country. The fertilizers must be delivered before April, or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing. In that case, we will have to improve one month further on the time. Now is Jan.

9499,"The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning, I feel really down. What’ s up? Well, actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday. Anything that distracts you from work?",0,"Yes, everything.

Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account?,0
9571,"Yes. Does the checking account come with a debit card? Yes.

9594,"Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price? Please tell me candidly. I look at it this way, suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price, even lower than their home price. We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market. That's the point. Your overhead is in your domestic price, but it can't be carried in the CIF price.",0,"But even with the overhead out, the export overhead must be put in. Finally, it comes to the same thing. Anyway, this is a quality item and should be sold on its value.",0

Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.,0
9598,"Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer? Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients. OK, so now we need a baking pan right? Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.",0,Done. So how long do we bake it for?,0

9611,"Thank you for coming tonight, Mrs. Webber. As a teacher, it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night. Of course! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve. Well Allen is a great student. He is a hard worker and very well behaved, however he does struggle a bit with math. I guess he gets that from me, I never did well in math when I was a kid. What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom.",0,"Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

9807,"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It’ s even worse. ” Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people’ s appetite. I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way? The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?",0,"Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.",0

Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society. That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes.",0,But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days. There's no such program on this year.,0
9813,"Yeah, these programs are gradually losing their appeal. No surprise. The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite. And they lack originality. Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol '. The same is true for ' My Hero '. Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince '.",0,I think producers are underestimating the audience. They should think of better ways to entertain the general public.,0

They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.",0,"So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate, don't you?",0

9867,"We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial. However, according to our records, the total amount of your order last year was moderate, which does not warrant an agency appointment. Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent. I'll come to that. My proposal is As far as I remember, we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone.

I know what you mean there. In many circumstances, people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake. And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet. Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines, like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine, alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself.

9898,"Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.",0,"Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.",0
9899,"All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level? That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.",0,"I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.",4

9908,"Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan. Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security? No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations. We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.",0,"Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York.

9959,"It's time to get up! I just went to bed! You shouldn't have stayed up so late watching TV. I told you we had to get an early start. I know, but that movie was just too good to leave. I guess I'll just have to pay the price and be sleepy.",0,Do you want to eat breakfast here?,0
9960,"Hi, I'm home! Can you double that recipe? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner. No problem. Who is it? Anyone I know? I don't think so.

What kind of sponsoring are we talking about? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is... It's not what you're thinking. These events will give us a wider exposure than most.

9999,"Well, why don’ t you come tomorrow? I’ ll stop by your house on my way out. I could try, but I can’ t say for sure if I’ ll get up in time. What time do you want to go?

10001,"It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars. Is it my choice as to who inspects this house? Yes, it is your choice as you are paying for it. Make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find. How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance?",0,Let’ s call them right now.

10481,"I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom. But when I face a stranger outside, I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out. You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking. Speech is a reflection of personality, you know. You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice, loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering. I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer. Your speech should not call attention to itself, but should reveal your individuality and ability.",0,I’ m very shy. I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer.,0
10482,"You’ d better overcome your nervousness. it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence. Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers, especially foreigners. In China, it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking. But in Western countries it is the opposite. Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity. Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded. Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview?",0,Yes. Don’ t eat onions or garlic before you come. If you do you’ ll have bad breath.,0

10514,"Well, you know how important a clean house is to your grandma. Yes, I hear about it every time she comes here. She was the head janitor at St. Mary's Hospital for thirty years, after all.

10522,"As I said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive. I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system. That's too much. We need to use the separate units, I guess.

So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars.",0,"Yes, that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent, of course.",0
10523,"You mean installation isn't included? I'm very surprised. No, Ma'am. Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units. In Taipei, you know, the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra. I know that, Ma'am. But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L. A., installation is charged separately.",0,"Yes, I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet.",0
10524,"I understand, Ma'am. And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars. It's a question of quality, Ma'am. At that price, you would not get good equipment. I've been in this business for almost twenty years. I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now, you will just have to replace the system after two years. I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars, installation included, I can accept.",0,Well.,0

10677,"I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem. I should say it is something we have never come across before. The Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA as we call it for short, imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States. Over the years, they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers. In my opinion, overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports.",0,"Ah, there's something in what you're saying. According to the present FDA regulations, the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States.",0
10678,"Why not? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad, and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers. Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are? I'd be quite willing to if I could, but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law, or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs. In that case, what can we do to help you? Have you any suggestions? Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C. I. F. basis for delivery in Hong Kong? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations.",0,"Do you think that's the only way out? You know we usually do the labeling, as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products.",0
10679,There is a very critical debate between the presidential candidates tonight. Do you know which channel it is on? Five I think. All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms. I used to be really interested in that. But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway. So why listen?,0,We have to. If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for.,0

So, you see, the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372, 000, and the owner's equity is $ 5,400, 000. That means that the total assets, which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities, are $ 8,772, 000.",0

What do you think about this? It’ s casual, yet sophisticated.",0
10702,"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It’ s too plain on its own. How about this scarf, these earrings, AMD an anklet? That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? That’ s a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.",4,"Thanks. You’ d be ok on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",4
10703,"Yep. Here it is. What do you think? That looks great. Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them? The leopard print sounds fabulous. Are they a name brand?

10723,"Yes, much better.

Well, are there any other advantages?",0,"Yes, most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",0

10726,"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it? I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life. You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art. An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.",4,Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong?,0
10727,"I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels. All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life. I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements. Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.",0,"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation, isn't it?",0
10728,"Have you washed any clothes yet? No, I've only washed my whites. When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in? Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?",0,Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle.,0
10729,"How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash? There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash? It's really only a small load. Do you mind washing my clothes?",0,Not at all. It's no problem.,4
10730,"Excuse me, I'd like to try some Chinese food. We serve excellent Chinese food. Which style do you prefer? I know nothing about Chinese food. Could you give me some suggestions? It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food, Shandong food, Sichuan food etc.",0,Is there any difference?,0
10731,"Yes, Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy. How about Sichuan food? Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot. They taste differently. Oh, really. I like hot food. So what is your recommendation for me?",4,I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious. We have a Sichuan food dining room. May I suggest you to go there? It's on the third floor.,0
10732,"Good morning, madam. I think I'm lost here. The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton. Do you know in which area? No, I am sorry I have no idea. I am a stranger here. I see.

10735,"Do you have Ginkgo trees here? We don't have them here, I'm afraid. Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather. What are these trees opposite to the pine trees? They are poplar trees. They are widely used in our lives.",0,I think I know that.,0
10736,"Steven, what's the expense of moving house? About 3 000 dollars. It costs a lot of money. Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings. Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses? I am afraid not, darling. Our expenses are mounting.",5,We have to cut back on our shopping from now on.,0
10737,"Mary, could you please come in for a short while? No problem. Mary, I'd like you to meet Richard, Our new executive in the marketing. Nice to meet you, Austin.",0,Welcome to our department. I hope you'll like it here.,0
10738,"By the way, Richard will assist me in the planning work. I hope you can work well together. Sure, if you've got any problem you can ask me. Thank you.It ' s very kind of you.

10743,"Ah! It hurts. Don't touch it. What part hurts? The shoulder. Well, maybe you broke it. But what I'm worried about is this cut.",0,It's not a cut. It's a gash! It's bigger than a cut! Ah! I need a doctor.,0
10744,"C'mon. Just don't move. I'm bleeding too much. We don't have a decent First Aid Kit, do we? Yes. My bike has one under the seat. Get it, quick!",0,"There's some tape, iodine, and cloth bandages. I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding. What we need is a tourniquet.",0
10745,I’ m having a problem. What’ s the problem? A pipe burst in my wall. Is the pipe causing any water damage?,0,The water is causing mildew.,0
10746,I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow. Can I just call someone myself to fix it? I don’ t think that would be a good idea. You won’ t do it until tomorrow.,0,I guess you have a point.,0
10747,"Here! Here! Use my card! No, you don't! I should treat my new brother-in-law! Not on your life! I'm the best man, so I pay! OK, OK. On one condition.",0,What's that?,0
10748,Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in. Where else haven't I been to yet? Not many but these ones.

I'll tell you now. The collections include ancient cases and caskets, tea sets, abacuses, precious sea shells and conches, jars and water abacuses for study use, drama costumes, agates, ancient coins, butterflies, fans, mini musical instruments, root-carving, rare stones and rocks, model ships, model cars. Enough, David! I can't wait anymore. Let's go right now! Okey, Okey.

10771,"During the last two years, there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad. If they steal the entire package, that would be theft. So they don't do that. Generally, thieves open the case and take part of the contents out. Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same. If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition, the steamship company doesn’ t have liability for pilferage. How do we protect ourselves? The insurance policy protects us.",0,"Is it true that products of high value such as watches, jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage?",0

I really like the light colors you have chosen. The pictures are nice too. Did you buy any new furniture? I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes.

10778,"That wardrobe looks quite big. Is it full of clothes? Yes. I have some many clothes stuffed into it. Perhaps I should get rid of some of them. There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore. I like to get rid of clothes that I don’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe. They take up too much space.

10788,"Have you ever shopped online? Quite often. It is very convenient, saving me a lot of time. Do you have some experiences to share with me? I want to have a try. You are asking the right person.

10793,"From the looks of this house from the outside, I don’ t really think that I want to go inside. From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let’ s see what the interior looks like. I am not impressed by the interior of this house. Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint.",0,"With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are?",0
10794,I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and spacious. Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space? The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we should go look at it since we are here. Is there a dead animal somewhere in here?,0,"Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you.",0

When was the last time you had a tune up? Not that long ago, I think it was four months ago.",0,We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers.,0
10799,"Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often? First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’ t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves. I see. What else? We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.",0,"Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’ t seem like a waste of time and money.",0

10807,"Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’ s get started! Let’ s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color. Now that our bread is ready, let’ s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’ s palate is different, but I’ m going to give you a few tips that you’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich. Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’ t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.",4,"Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!",4

10812,"Excuse me. Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo? Well, you can take the No. 36 bus from here, but then you have to walk about 30 minutes. That doesn't sound too bad.

10813,"My dear, it's five flights up!

Does that look like hail to you? it does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.",0,that's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.,0
10829,ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here. how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know.

I really can't accept that.,0
11006,"What's your counter-offer then? To conclude the deal, I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help. 15 % is impossible. That'll leave us almost no profit.

11023,"Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms. I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents.

11063,"How often are stockholders meetings held? Stockholders meetings are held biannually. Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall. In between the meetings, each stockholder receives biannual reports. Financial statements are made once a year. What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings? I'm guessing not a large percentage... You're right, it's a low percentage. Also, in order to attend meetings, you have to hold a certain amount of shares.

11066,"Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging? Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display. Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive. Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.",0,What about the outer packing?,0
11067,"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton. Cartons? Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes. Could you use wooden cases instead?",0,Why use wooden cases?,0
11068,"I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load. The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle. They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo. The stevedores will see to that. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps. Silk blouses are not fragile goods. They can stand a lot of jolting. Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London. If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined. No need to worry about that. The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof, and as the boxes are made of cardboard, they will be handled with care.",0,"Well, I don't want to take any chances. Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage.",0
11069,"Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage. Maybe so, but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage, the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing, or packing unsuitable for sea voyage. But cartons are quite seaworthy. They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports. There are never any complaints from our clients, and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W. P. A. and T. P. N. D. If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing, we would be quite willing to accept cartons.",0,"I'm sorry, but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers. We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy, but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap.",0

Do you remember the name of the street, or one or two landmarks?",0,"A bookstore, probably. With a yellow and orange logo.",0
11596,"Good, any other clues? I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away. I waited for the traffic light for a very long time. Oh, is there a bank near there, Standard Charted possibly? Oh, yeah, I got it, there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there.",0,"That's the second branch hotel of Hilton.

11620,"It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods. And that is? How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York? I'm afraid we can't agree to that. We concluded the business with you here in Houston, and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York. We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.",0,"It's like this. There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka, while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent. If shipment were effected from Hong Kong, we could receive the goods much earlier.",0
11621,"I see. You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong, where they can be transshipped. Is that the idea? Yes, exactly, because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date. Your idea may be a good one, but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong. How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network? You may choose either one as port of shipment. It makes no difference to us. There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York. It sounds all right to me, but I will have to think about it. I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow. If I choose Seattle, will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March?",0,"We'll try our best. Anyway, we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April.",0

11634,"Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too? I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day. So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think. It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep.",0,"Yes, that's what I plan to do.
