0,"Say, Jim, how about going for a few beers after dinner? You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness. What do you mean? It will help us to relax. Do you really think so?

1,"I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends. That's a good idea. I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them. Sounds great to me! If they are willing, we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun, too. Good.Let ' s go now.",4,All right.,4

5,"Let’ s see... you’ re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we’ ll both have interesting summers! That’ s bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. No, it’ s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’ re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?",0,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!,4

It’ ll be a good investment for you.",4,"Yeas, when will you buy a house?",0
9,"Hi, Becky, what's up? Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall. What's the problem? She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she's around.",0,For example?,0
10,"Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her. No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen. It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids. My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.",0,You said she used to? How did you stop her?,0
11,"How are Zina's new programmers working out? I hate to admit it, but they're good. And fast. The Filipino kid is a genius.

42,"how do you usually get to school? I usually ride my bike. Which form of transport do you prefer to use? I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle, but when I feel lazy, I drive my car. I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution!",0,"I agree, but I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.",0
43,"cars might be convenient, but they're so bad for the environment. do you have a car? no. I used to have one though.

44,"that's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, insurance, and repairs. if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, you will get lots of exercise, too!

47,"On, darn. The grocery store is closed. Yeah, this one closes at ten. We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth. Alright. We are out of everything. I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day.",0,"I know, our schedules are so weird. Sometimes, the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that’ s open when we get home.",0
48,"Dad, where are we off to? First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink. Then we will visit the University Museum. Where are we going to have a drink? There is a coffee shop round the corner. Can you see that big building at the end of the road?",0,Yes?,0
49,That is a bank. The coffee shop is opposite the bank. Good. I will have hot chocolate. A stop! Wait for the lights to turn green. When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you.,0,Sorry. How far is the museum?,0
50,"How about going to the cinema tonight? That's great. What's on tonight? I am not sure about the name of the film, but I know it's a romantic one. Romantic? I am afraid I like thrillers better.",0,Don't you think it's too bloody?,0
51,"I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. Really? Are you sure? Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back. Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!",0,Really?,6
52,"Excuse me, what's the screen near your steering wheel for? It's a portable TV. It's a popular thing now. Oh, that's new to me. So what's on everyday? News about current affairs, documentaries, music, movies, noncommercial ads and so on.",0,Is there anything interesting?,0
53,"Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?",0,Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.,0
54,"Oh, no! How dreadful! Look at the view from the window. Oh, dear. That’ s terrible. Not at all what I expected.",2,"It’ s awful, isn’ t it?",2
55,"What do you do in your free time, Nancy? Well, I like playing the violin. Really? How long have you been playing the violin? About ten years so far. I started learning when I was in middle school.",0,That's really interesting.,4

58,"Instead of tackling somebody, you just have to touch them with two hands, or if it is flag football, grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing. I see. It's safer then right? Exactly. We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts. If you want to learn and play a little, you're welcome to join us. I'll give it a try. Give me a call and let's go down together.",4,Ok. I'll call you Saturday morning.,4
59,"What upsets you? My parents called. As usual, they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s. Easier said then done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date. It is not your mother finding one for you? I will find one myself, of course. I’ m a modern girl.",0,"Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, the latest type.",0
60,"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea. No, there is an updated virgin, three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes. I don’ t think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time. I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, so-called love at first sight.",0,"Anyway, I don’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.",2
61,"Are you going to the party on Saturday? I was thinking about it. Are you? Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun. Really? Well, what time does it start?",6,It starts at 8,0

63,Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades? Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern? Am I failing? Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?,0,I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.,5
64,"I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve? I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis. Having a regular study routine and following it is very important, right? I'll try ; it's hard!",0,Thanks for stopping by!,0
65,"Oh, my God! I've been cheated! What? What did you buy? It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it! What is it? Why did you buy a brick?",0,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",1
66,And? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. And it's a brick? Yes.,0,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,6
67,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?",0,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
68,"Hey, Mary, what's up? Just so so. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time, so we decided to meet again tonight. Oh, that's exciting. What does this guy look like? Is he hot? Well, I didn't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! And we have so much in common. We like the same team, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.",0,It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?,4
69,"What’ s up? You don’ t look too good. Yeah, my head hurts, that’ s all. I’ Ve been in physics class all day. It’ s killer! I liked physics. It’ s all math, really. arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. Yeah, yeah, but today’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.",0,A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’ s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.,0
70,"It’ s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’ s what the math says. Math, sheath. What’ s the evidence? There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!",0,"Anyway, it’ s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’ s the scientific rigor in that?",0
71,"Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning. But people have different views about lifelong learning. How do you understand lifelong learning? I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning Does that mean studying all the time? I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors.",0,Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer.,0
72,"You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active. Me too. To keep up with the changing world, one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things. You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.",0,Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.,6
73,It smells like an ashtray in here! Hi honey! What’ s wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? What’ s wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking. No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!,0,"Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It’ s not like you can just light up like before.",1
74,"It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy. I get antsy not because you praise a guy, but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him. How come you think of him that way? Because you seem to have lost your vigilance. You should be on the watch out.",2,I have no reason to distrust him. He's never caused any harm.,0
75,"Have you signed up to join the company’ s Christmas party? Sure, I have. Will you join? I will. You know, as a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere. You are right. Our company’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.",0,I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.,0
76,"hi, Emily, do you know that guy over there? The tall one? Sure, that's Drive, he works with Lily. He is cute.What dose he do? I'm not sure, he is a manager I think.",0,Really? Are you going to introduce us?,6
77,"You didn't ring me last night. You said you would. I'm sorry to have made you disappointed. That's all right. But why were you so rude to me at lunch. Was I? Sorry, I didn’ t mean to be. I do apologize.",6,And why are you yarning now? Are you bored?,0
78,"Hi, Nicole. Did you have a good weekend? Yes, I did. But I feel tired today. Really? Why? Well, on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis. Then on Sunday I hiked in the country.",0,"And I bet you studied, too.",0
79,"What’ s the life expectancy in your country? I’ m not sure, but probably about 75 years. How about in your country? About 70, I think. This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population. It’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world. I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age, because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly.",0,Perhaps we need to have more babies! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday.,0
80,"Did she? That’ s great. However, if we have too many children, that will have a bad effect on the enviroment. How’ s your son these days? Oh, he’ s fine. Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays. He’ ll be a teenager before you know it! Teenagers are often rebellious! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child?",0,"I had mine when I was 24. that’ s a little young. I’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties., or even in your early thirties if you have a good career.",0
81,"Yes, I think you’ re right. I’ m thinking about having a child, but not just yet. Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country? Yes, there is. Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don’ t often succeed. Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country. Sometimes they give them too much freedom.",0,"It’ s almost impossible to get the right balance. If you are too strict, kids might ignore you. If you are too lenient, they might go wild.",0
82,"Hey, Mark, long time no see. Julie! It's good to see you again. How have you been? Great. I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand. Really? How was it?",4,Fantastic! I didn't want to come back.,4
83,"I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful. They are. And not only that the people are friendly, but also the food is delicious, not to mention cheap. I do like Thai food.

I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job.

I'm planning to return to China after graduation.",0,Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.,0
90,"Do you have any particular hobbies, Tom? Oh, yes. I love playing badminton, table tennis and computer games. And playing the games has become my favorite. I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers. And they don't care about their own health at all. How about you? I'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, but I think it's stimulating.",0,"You won't play online games full of violence, will you?",0

He has to catch the killer, but there’ s very little evidence. It’ s a psychological th Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director. I have had disagreement with every director. I’ Ve worked with. We’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don’ t no",0,Critics are not very happy with the movies that you’ Ve made recently. Does that bother you?,0
92,"Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think. Did you do you own stunts in the movie? I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn’ t let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I’ ll leave that to the experts in future. Thank you very much for doing this interview.",4,My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?,4
93,"What did you say? I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk? Well, I feel a little tired. Come on! A little labor, much health.",0,Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter.,0
94,"Thank god you showed up when you did! He’ s insane! Do you think we should call the police? Don’ t worry about it, I’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it. I can’ t believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job! I know! Well... he said I’ m not pregnant. I’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing. I want you to know that I didn’ t do it on purpose... Don’ t apologize! From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven’ t thought of you.And now that I’ m with you again, I’ m... I’ m just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can’ t handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, my soul mate. What can I do?",0,"Just hold me... I’ ll always be here for you, no matter what. And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, steven.",0
95,"Zina, can I talk to you about something personal? As long as it doesn't take too long. My boyfriend says I work too much. That I spend more time with you than with him. Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend?",0,"He said not to bother coming back. And I said, fine, I won't.",0

I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?",0
98,"Hi, Francis, how was your business trip? It was a nightmare. What’ s up? Actually, the business trip itself was very successful. We arrived on time, we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year.",0,"Sounds quite fruitful, why do you call it still a nightmare then?",0
99,Which pair of jeans do you like best? I really like the straight legs. But they aren't very fashionable. What about these? I don't like the way they sag down. I feel like I have plumber butt in them.,0,That's the style! You just wear boxers.,0

109,"Stop running around in front of the TV, will you? Why don't you just sit and watch? I've tried, but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program. Then stay away. No one is keeping you from doing that. Don't be so irritable. I just don't understand the program, that's all.",0,"All right, I will explain it to you later on. Now scram.",0
110,"Okay, can I ask you something direct? Ha! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush. Fair enough. Give it to me straight. Did she bully you into this? No, seriously... I really want this.",0,"I tell ya, when I got the invite, it really threw me for a loop. You've done a complete 180.",0
111,My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another. She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay. It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do. But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more? It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment.,0,What time is the right moment?,0
112,"are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night? of course. Is the dinner still on? yes, I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place. we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice.",0,"that's what I thought you would do. Listen, I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood. It's just down the street from all the bars. You probably don't want to be walking around after dark.",0
113,"it can't be that bad. I wish it wasn't, but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here. really? I never would have guessed. The criminals must only come out in the evenings, because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime. do me a favor, and take a taxi. It'd make me feel a lot better.",0,"ok, we will. How do you get around in the evenings?",0
114,"What do you need? I need to use the Internet. You have your library card, right? Yes, I do.",0,There is a wait right now to use the computers.,0
115,That’ s fine. Would you please write your name on this list? Then what? I will call you when a computer is free.,0,How do I log on to the computer?,0
116,What a nice tie you are wearing! Thank you.But does it really look all right? Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly. Then does it go well with my sweater?,4,Yes.You look very smart today.,4
117,"What do you make of the case? If you ask me, I don’ t think it’ s guilty. What do you mean by saying so? I mean it’ s not his fault.",0,"Oh, yeah?",0
118,I have a real problem when I meet people. What is it? Maybe I can help. I never know when to shake hands and when not to. Can you tell me something about it? Do you come from a country where they shake hands?,0,"Oh yes. Men, women, and children shake hands all the time.",0
119,"It’ s very simple. Men shake hands, women and children don’ t. But some women do shake hands. And now a lot of children have such good manners, they shake hands too. Well, a good rule to follow is, for men you hold out your hand, for women and children, you wait and see what they do. That sounds easy enough.",4,"Sure. Once you get the hang of it, it’ s a piece of cake! It’ s nothing to worry about.",4
120,"Sam, I am so sorry. It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it. Don't worry about it. I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well. Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it. We did try to phone you, but you and Jane must have gone out. Yes, Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us.",0,"Oh, yes, I know the one. How was the food?",0
121,"The food was excellent, but Jane ordered a birthday cake, which they forgot about. So as you can see, you were not the only one. Oh, no. Yes, Jane was quite upset about it. The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert, but still... I would think this was the least they could do.",0,In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while.,0
122,"I can't believe Mr. Fro didn't buy it. Who does that guy think he is anyway? Bill Gates? He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked. Time to order. Balista, today I want a skinny triple latte. When did you start worrying about your weight?",0,I'm not. I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today. Why? Do you think I'm fat?,0
123,"Come on, Tara. Let’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets. The movie is starting in a few minutes. We can’ t break into the line. Don’ t be so impatient. We’ ll be at the front of the line soon. Two tickets, please. How much are they? Oh no, Ari. I didn’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight. Let’ s go Dutch. I’ ll pay my own way. I insist.",0,I’ m looking forward to this film. I read a good review of it in this morning’ s newspaper.,0
124,"Do you often buy magazines? I buy a computer magazine every month. It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments. Why don’ t you find the information on the internet instead? Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for. Besides, I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes.",0,Do you have an online edition of that magazine?,0
125,"Mumm. Those burgers smell great. It's perfect day for a barbecue. It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way. Oh, hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. What's your name again?",4,"Barbara. But please, just call me Barb.",4

127,Wow! I can't believe I'm standing here! What are you so excited about? I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art! What's the big deal? It's just a picture of some woman.,0,"I've seen it so many times in books, but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person.",4
128,"There are tons of other paintings that I think are better. Maybe so, but do you have any idea how much this one is worth? No, how much is it worth? About 80 million dollars.",4,Whoa.,6
129,"hey, Maris, are you a part-timer? part-timer? Is that a new buzzword? oh, it’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days. So are you? sure, I have a part-time job as a bartender.",0,cool! It must be amazing to work at a bar!,4
130,"yeah, but I’ m not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset. that’ s true. I’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job? of course. There’ s always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world. you mean you got working experience, right?",0,not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.,0
131,"it must be very demanding. sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, it’ s easy to figure out. really? It sounds interesting. maybe you can come to the bar one day and I’ ll show you around.",0,great. I’ m looking forward to it.,4
132,"Have you seen that house? Yes, it looks interesting. You're right. I love it very much. It must be old.",4,At least more than 100 years old.,4
133,Let's enter it! I can't open the door. It must be locked. Let me ask the old woman in that reception office.,0,She can't answer you.,0
134,"Jim, how was your weekend? I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there. That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you go swimming, too? Sure. I think it’ s a fantastic place to go.",4,I couldn’ t agree more. That’ s an ideal place for a vacation.,4
135,We're having a sixties party next week. Do you want to come? What is a sixties party? You come dressed in anything from the sixties. That sounds like fun. But where can I get clothes that old?,4,Check out your mom's closet. I'll bet she still has something.,4
136,"I want to improve my handwriting, and I've practiced it for several weeks, but nothing happened. You see, my handwriting is still bad. Oh, come on. You know it's a long process, you have to be patient. I know it, but I don't know when I can make it better. A, whatever you do, the most important is perseverance. So you have to hang on there, the longer, the better. Then some day, you will find you've already made a lot of progress.",0,"Yeah, you are right. I must stop complaining and stick to it every day.",4
137,"I’ m so excited, mother. Oh, a new baby! My first grandchild. And my first nephew. He looks a lot like you, mum. He does. Do you think so? Well, I guess. He does look a lot like me. Oh, he’ s got Richard’ s eyes though.",4,"Yes, he does have Richard’ s eyes. The baby even looks like you than Richard does.",4
138,The music has started. How do you like this waltz? It's very nice. May I ask you for a dance?,4,Certainly.,4
139,"Do you speak only English in the class, or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish? Oh, we never speak Spanish in class! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English. I suppose she's right. Does she speak English very slowly? Not always. Sometimes we don't understand her. Then she has to repeat what she said.",0,It must be interesting to study English.,0
140,"Doris, I'm glad you're home. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do! What is it? What happened? I think someone is stalking me. No, it can't be. Really? Who?",6,"I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring.He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.",0
141,"What did you do? I didn't do anything. Finally, he left.But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too. Did he leave when you left? Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.",0,What did you do?,0
142,"He followed me all the way home! That's about five blocks. And around corners too.So he was definitely following you. Yes, he was. I'm not imagining it.Finally, just when I got home, I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there. He didn't smile. He just stood there. It was so obvious.What should I do? I'm so scared. Can I call the police? Actually, I don't think you can call the police. Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything. And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again, then maybe you should call.",0,Why can't I call the police now? He was definitely following me!,3
143,"Han Maimed, What's your plan for the weekend? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it. To tell you the truth, I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school. It’ s better to get to know it. What about you? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays. Oh, my God! John, I didn’ t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory.",6,"Come on, Han Maimed, don’ t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion.",0
144,"But I’ m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they? Yes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world. I've heard about it a little bit before, but I don’ t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist? That’ s a little complicated. You’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people’ s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion.",0,Really?,6
145,Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England. Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans. How come? I mean why most of them were religious people?,6,"That’ s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries.",0
146,"So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England? Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College. Why did they want to found a college? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well.",0,"Oh, I see.",0
147,"Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ', without a formal name. When did it begin to be called Harvard University? In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman. It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion.",0,"Therefore, it’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard.",0
148,"Wow, I didn’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S. I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard. Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related.",0,That’ s right. I have a lot to learn from you.,4
149,"What do you do in summer? I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? I don’ t often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. What do you do in winter?",0,"Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I’ m feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.",0
150,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? Pardon? What university would you enter? University? Why? You asked me last year.",6,"Oh, I forget.Sorry.",0
151,"I went to Harvard University. Did you? And what course did you take there? God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you? I've not known.Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.",0,I did a B. A. in economics.Remember?,0
152,I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion. Fun for you! Do you get to do anything you want? Yep. And I should start planning now. Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions?,0,Just about. There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone.,0
153,"Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia. Nice to meet you, Lvan.My name is Alike. I'm from Japan. To me English is a difficult language. A second language is always difficult.",0,"True, but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language.",0
154,"What did you think of the film? I liked it. I thought it was great. Yes, I liked it, too. Did you like the acting? Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?",4,Not really. I thought it was disappointing.,2
155,"What’ s up? You don’ t look too good. Yeah, my head hurts, that’ s all. I’ Ve been in physics class all day. It’ s killer! I liked physics. It’ s all math, really, arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff. Yeah, yeah, but today’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.",0,A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’ s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.,6
156,"It’ s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff. Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’ s what the math says. Math, sheath. What’ s the evidence? There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!",0,"Anyway, it’ s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’ s the scientific rigor in that?",0
157,"Which film shall we see? There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert? Yes, I'd love to.Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there? Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?",0,"No, I'm not hungry.",0
158,"Bill, how can you hear so happy today? Aha. I've read of my roommate. I made a move today. Really? What was the matter? You knew Brain Locker?",0,"Brain Locker? No, I don't think so. What does he look like?",0
159,"Hey! How was your first day of class? I’ m in level two and I’ m loving my class this semester! It’ s great being in a class of international students! Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. That’ s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’ s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, That’ s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstan, and o",0,"Well, I think you’ re pretty lucky actually. You’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.",0
160,"Good morning, Miss Li. Morning, Mike. I’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday. I’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave. How do you feel today?",0,I feel much better now.,0
161,"Do you like flowers? Of course, I like. What's your favorite flower? Forsythia. It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival.",4,Spring is a lively season.,4
162,Yes. How about you? I admire plum blossoms very much. It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter. You have a perfect taste! It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow. I admire the bravery of plum blossoms.,4,But it used to be ignored by many people.,0
163,"What is the weather like today? It stops snowing, but there's a bit wind. And the streets are covered with ice. Do you know what the temperature is today? I missed today's weather for cast in the radio",0,"It seems 10 degree below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather, but do hate when it get slippery.",0
164,"What kind of music do you like listening to? I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don’ t you? Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work. I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.",0,Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.,0
165,Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. Yes. That’ s why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I’ m cooking or doing other housework. I’ Ve got a few classical music CD’ s. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power. You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.,0,"That’ s a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.",4
166,"There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street. I hope that they have a good menu. Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish. That's right. You don't drink coffee, do you?

167,"Darling, I have news for you. Bobby and his wife, Evelyn, are going to have a baby soon. Really? I thought his wife couldn’ t have a baby. Actually they’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday. Oh, what a coincidence! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it. He likes children and always wants a child of his own.",6,"In fact, they’ re both very excited about the coming baby. Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like, since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese.",4
168,"Well, I am a regular member of this club. Do you have to pay to join? Yes, membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars. Wow, that much? Don't they have any public courses?",6,"Very few, unfortunately.",0

It can stop quickly.",4,"Hey, just watch out for cops or you’ re gonna end up in the slammer. You know you tend to go fast?",0
175,"Which church do you attend? I am Mormon, so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. What’ s the difference between this and other Churches? Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church.",0,Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?,0
176,"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all. Do you believe that Mormons have all of it? Yes. Why do you really go to church?",0,"We gather together to encourage each other, because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church.",0
177,"Hello! What are you reading about in the newspaper? Hello! I was exhausted some studying, so I decided to read the newspaper to relax. Unfortunately, the news is so depressing.

284,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York, to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida. That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there. But if the sunshine is too strong, it might damage the eyes and the skin. You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer.",0,I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.,0
285,I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully '. It's a very good article. What does it say? A lot of things.

The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage. What do you mean?",0,"Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don’ t go together.",2
294,"I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities. People can’ t have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, but there’ s more to do. I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They’ re so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings. I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.",4,The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There’ s so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.,4

296,Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days. Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him.

I know, but I don't have a choice, my boss has complete control over our work schedules. I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week. Well, I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work... No, not exactly, I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime. Overtime is our own time.",0,"What?! Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights!

But I’ m sure you’ re able to find a balance between them. Why not try it? I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake. But I’ m a senior now, I don’ t want to miss the chance this time. I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind.",0,"I’ ll try, but what if she insists?",0
303,"just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding. And more importantly, you can manage both your study and the job. do you think it will work? sure. Every cloud has its silver lining. Just try. ok, I’ ll do that. Thank you, Iris.",4,"sure. Good luck, Maria!",4

And my internship will last 1 week. I'm still a student now. Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here?",0,"Of course not. You know, there are many foreign customers like you here. And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English.",0
311,"Oh, are you an English student? Or you just study English for interest's sake? No, I'm not an English student. But I do like English.

Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to develop their own view of life. Parents usually try to discourage them, but they don’ t often succeed. Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country.

355,"Television is undoubtedly a great invention, but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough. Lesley, got a television. how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch? I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me, rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish.

Real hackers call these people crackers, and want nothing to do with them.",0,So they are two totally different concepts.,0
410,"Well, the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible and not very bright, and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer.

I’ m not sure I like the idea of that. I don’ t want people copying me or other people. It could be very confusing. According to the article, you have no real need to worry.

414,Thanks for helping me up. Are you OK? I didn't mean to put you in danger. I'm the hazardous one here. I made three people fall over! That takes talent...,0,I'm so humiliated! What's that man saying? Everyone's laughing!,0

416,"What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space? I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left. It was just awe-inspiring. It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth, where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance. I wasn't quite prepared for that. It's inevitably etched in my memory. When viewing the Earth from space, do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind? Detached. You're literally detached from one planet, captured by another. Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y, it stays in view the whole time.",0,There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality.

It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground. There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission. It seemed to fizzle out. Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner? I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair, that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on. But only time will tell. You had gone to the moon twice, orbited space around the Earth lots of times, and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have. How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness? I just can't wait.",0,"If I were the man making the decisions, you could get in line tomorrow. I strongly support ordinary people going into space. Unfortunately, I don't think it will be in the near future.",0
418,Where did you go yesterday? I went to play tennis in the public park. How often do you play tennis? Twice a week. How about you?,0,I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.,0

Yeah, he often scores by free kicks in crucial games. But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks. Certainly not.

I downloaded a beautiful song the other day. We can learn it together now. Great. Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary?",0,"Yes, just in case we run into me new characters.",0
469,"Where to, miss? Hi! Crenshaw and Hawthorne, at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner. Sure thing. So, where are you flying in from? From China.",0,"Really? You don’ t look very Chinese to me, if you don’ t mind me saying so.",6
470,"It’ s fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products. Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you? Don’ t you know it’ s rude to ask a lady her age? Don’ t get me wrong! It’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!",0,"Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself?",4
471,"Have you thought of moving at all, Sarah? We’ Ve thought about it, but my husband and I can’ t afford it right now. The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums, which is something I don’ t want to do. Buying a house can be expensive, but there are ways to find cheaper houses. Like what?",0,"Well, sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community. You’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day, but you would definitely save money doing it that way.",0
472,"That’ s a good idea. Do you know anyone who has done that before? Sure, my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way. They’ re pretty satisfied with it. Is the house pretty run-down. Not at all. The woman, who owned it, took good care of it. But when she died, she had no family left and no will, so the government had to sell it for her.",0,Was it a very old house?,0
473,"Do Mona and Jim need a new house? No, they have a big new fancy house. Does Jim make a lot of money? Yes, he does. He is a science fiction writer.",0,Does Jim need to make more money?,0
474,"Afraid so. The more the better. What do they need all that money for? Well, they spend it pretty quick. New clothes, new computers and new cars every year. And they’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress, she likes to spend a lot of money. Do they have any children?",0,No. They want children but no luck yet.,0
475,"What does Jim like to do? Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money. What does Mona like to do? Oh, she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, and she has quite a bit of jewelry.",0,Wow... She sounds like a high maintenance wife.,0
476,I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government. Politics can be an expensive hobby. She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps. Politics is a hard game to play.,0,She might do well. Everyone seems to like her.,0
477,"Are you alright, child? Hey, I still know my name. What did the nurse say? She said I have a fever but nothing major.",0,"In that case, you should go home and get plenty of rest.",0
478,"Who was the best teacher that you ever had? That would have to be Miss Baymler, my fourth grade teacher. What was she like? She was patient, kind, fun, smart, caring, and yet strict, too. I really learned a lot from her.",4,What kind of things did you learn?,0
479,"She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do. Anything? Do you really believe that we can do anything? If you really want to do something and you work hard at it, I believe you can do it. You said she was strict. Did she have a lot of rules?",0,"She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable. For example, the students had to treat each other with respect, or they would be disciplined.",0
480,"I see. She sounds like she really cared about her students. Yes. She treated us all fairly. She don’ t have any teacher’ s pets. Really? Doesn’ t every teacher have a teacher’ s pet? Well. To be honest, I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades. However, Miss Baymler didn’ t treat me any differently. She really didn’ t have any teacher’ s pets.",0,Do you know what she is doing now?,0
481,"As a matter of fact, I do. After she taught our class, she got married and moved to another city. Then, she started writing children’ s book. Have you ever read one of the books? Of course! Both children and adults enjoy her books. Why don’ t you recommend one to me?",0,ok! I’ ll bring one to you next time.,4
482,"Look, daddy is on again. Don't you think he is handsome? To some extent, he is. And what do you think we move to a better place? I can't see him clearly from here. The seats in the middle of this stadium are great, but they're already occupied by somebody else. Oh, thank you for pointing that out. By the way, have you been following NBA for this season?",4,"Of course, tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game.",0
483,"Who plays who? Rockets vs Lakers. Yao Ming, my idol, will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience. It's amazing. And when did he begin to play in the NBA? In 2002. And since then he has attracted more attention than ever.",0,I can't consider you as a little kid any more. I know he is very tall.,0
484,"Oh, you know something. He is 2.26 meters tall. But he is also nimble and skillful. I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game. Yes, what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game. That's really terrible. Oh, God, we forgot to cheer for Daddy.",0,"Never mind. After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming, right?",0
485,"What’ s the date today? December the fifteenth. The day after tomorrow is little Tom’ s birthday. Right. What present should we give him this time? By the way, how old is he? Thirteen today and tomorrow. Fourteen the day after tomorrow.",0,How time flies! He’ s a big boy now.,0
486,"Do you hear what happened to Sally? No, what? She had to go to the hospital. Why?",0,She passed out in class. Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days.,0
487,"Why on earth would she do that? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days? That's crazy! Yeah, but that's what she did. I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies. And all for a certain look. Well, it's not just the girl’ s fault. It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying, It's in to be thin. It's hard for them not to listen.",0,"True, but there are limits. Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another. No one forces them to do this.",0
488,"Have you found another job yet, Sally? No, I haven't, but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper. What kind of job are you looking for? Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel.",0,You haven't had any experience in either of those fields.,0
489,"Hi. Are you new in this class? Yes, I am. I really don't know anyone. My name is Steven. What's your name? My name is Bill. How are your lessons going?",0,Very well. And my favorite subject is Chinese.,0
490,"Robert, this is my friend, Mrs. Smith. Hi, Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Mrs. Smith, what do you do for work?",0,I'm a doctor.,0
491,Oh. Where do you work? New York University hospital in New York City. What do you do? I'm a teacher. What do you teach?,0,I teach English.,0
492,"Hah! For three hours while you threw up. And Femi dumped me for that. I really loved her. I'm so sorry, Taylor. Go talk to her. I'm sure she'd be happy to see you. She probably wouldn't even recognize me. She's probably married. Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you. So get out there, Tiger!",0,Was she really? So you're telling me there's a chance?,0
493,"Oh, Ralph, I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space. Disasters have happened before. If the spaceship were out of order... You should be optimistic about this. Things have taken a good turn. You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible. But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors? It's once in blue moon.",0,What do you think is the real danger man faced in space?,0
494,"Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work. What a life! I've had enough of it. Cool down, man. Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic. But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. What should I do then? I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour.",4,"I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, polled air on the road?",2
495,"How many people are there in your family? Five. Besides my parents and me, there are my brother and sister. That’ s a big family. How old is your brother? Eighteen.",0,What about your sister?,0

497,"What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps. I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated. Come on, nothing can be that bad. But promise me, you'll keep it a secret.",0,"Ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?",0
498,"I've fallen in love with my boss. Really? Is he married? Bo, of course not. He is still single. Then what's your problem?",0,I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.,5
499,"Oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip. Worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days. Office romance is very tricky. It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.",5,"Cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.",0
500,How may I help you? I want to return this video. Is that all you need? I also need to check these books out.,0,Anything else?,0
501,That’ s everything. I need your library card. I have it. Here you go. Do you need anything else?,0,That’ s everything.,0
502,Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday? I did. Let me go get it for you. Here you go. Thanks so much. I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish.,4,I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries.,0
503,"I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys. But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon. Yeah, but that was before the guys ask me to join the team. So what?",0,"You know how much I want to be on the team, and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance.",0
504,"I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday, and I did. I know, and I will. When? After baseball practice.",0,"And then, it'll be dinner time, then homework, and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise.",0
505,"What stresses you out the most? Probably my parents. How so? Well, during school, they wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job. And finally, they want me to get married.",0,You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents.,0
506,"Your parents are not like that? Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much. You're lucky. What do you do to deal with the stress?",0,"Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, but that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning.",0
507,What's the weather like? I don't know. I just woke up. Why don't you look outside? Okay. It looks like rain.,0,Why do you say that?,0
508,The sky is gray. Is it raining right now? No. How do you know?,0,The street isn't wet.,0
509,"Hey there, you look a little lost. Are you new here? Yeah how’ d you know? You can always spot the newbies. I can give you a few pointers if you want. Were you trying to use this machine here? Yeah! I just started my training today and I’ m not really sure where to begin.",0,"It’ s ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

510,"Do you like ice skating? I have never tried it. Then you've got to try it. Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday. Sorry, I don't think I can.",0,Friday then. How about it?,0
511,"Gordon, you're ever so late. Yes, I am sorry. I missed the bus. But there's a bus every ten minutes, and you are over 1 hour late. Well, I missed several buses.",0,How on earth can you miss several buses?,6
512,"I, ah..., I got have late. Oh, come on, Gordon, it's the afternoon now. Why were you late really? Well, I... I lost my wallet, and I... Have you got it now?",0,"Yes, I found it again.",0
513,"Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it. Oh, Goodness, please not again.That ' s what we did last week. No, we didn't. Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness. Right, it was a chick flick, just like this one, so what's the difference? Besides, this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen. Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen.",0,"Oh, yeah, and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie, didn't you?",0
514,"Oh, sure, it was great. I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap. It wasn't that bad, and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant. That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much. And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken.",0,"But when I pick the restaurant, we go to a place that has both chicken and fish. I always respect your food preferences.",0
515,"How's your new job going? Really well, thanks. How are you finding your new boss? She's not bad. She's a bit bossy, but I'm sure I'll get used to her.",0,Would you rather have her or your old boss back?,0
516,She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down. How about your new co-workers? They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work. Do you miss your old co-workers?,0,Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.,0
517,"Do people in different departments get along with each other? Sure. Since we work together in teams, we have to get along with each other.

522,"how about this blue sweater? that's a good idea. When did you buy it? Is it a name brand? yes, but I bought it when it was on sale, 50 % off the original price.

551,"What do you think are the main causes of war today? I’ d say the main reason is poverty. Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little. If their neighbors have some resources, they try to steal them by military force. It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars. People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country. Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years. It seems they will never end.",0,How do you think they could be ended?,0
552,"I don’ t think that there is any easy way. The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country. At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate. The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that. So, if the cause is poverty, there should be a program to make the country richer. If the problem is resources, share them. It sounds easy when you say it like that. In reality, it’ s harder to make peace between countries. Yes. It is. One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support. Wars are very expensive.",0,The problem is that many poor people might suffer.,0

564,"Well, why don’ t you come tomorrow? I’ ll stop by your house on my way out. I could try, but I can’ t say for sure if I’ ll get up in time. What time do you want to go?

565,"Well, the way you drive, Jen... I still don't think that's a good idea. I really love this music. It's a compilation. I know. It's a mix of all the latest songs. And you got them off the Net?",0,No. I recorded these from your Cds.,0
566,"Um, which of them is the better typist? Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully. Is there any difference in their short hand? Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary’ s short hand is the best in her class.",0,How about languages?,0
567,"Hello, Ann! Is that you? Yes, it is. Hi, Tom! It's a real surprise to see you here. It's been a long time! What's new? Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well?",4,Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.,4

569,"Ok... I’ ll talk to you later. Bye Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’ s so hard to talk to him at times. Maybe it’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.",0,"Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.",0

572,"Jenny, I was wondering... if you.. eh are you busy this Friday? Yes, Friday I have a class, right after work. Oh, what about Saturday? Are you free then? Saturday my parents are coming to town. What’ s up?",0,What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?,0
573,"Excuse me? Is this where I register? I’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester. Yes, of course. I need your student ID please. Here you are. Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year. Is this information correct?",0,Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.,0

You are registered now. you’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.",4
575,"Is your city a historical place? Not rally. 200 years ago, it was just a small insignificant village. How did it grow into such a large place? Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here. The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre.",0,"As the city grew, it must have absorbed many village nearby.",0
576,"Most of our customers are foreigners. How many foreign languages can you speak, Elizabeth? Two. French and Spanish. And how well can you speak them? Well, French was my best subject at school. I can read and write it pretty well.",0,And how about your Spanish?,0

The nick name for your zone, address, gender and so on. Some of them are privacy, so you have the right to keep secret here.",0,All information is filled in and now I can design my zone.,0
578,"You can choose one type to make it as your background, and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it, so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone. Now everything is OK. I can write my blog, right? Certainly. ( Half an hour, Janice begins shouting excitedly. ) What's the matter with you?",0,Look! David gives his following-comment on my first blog. He is my first visitor.,4
579,"Do you remember Tina, my good friend? Yes. She just broke up with her boyfriend. Well, that happens. I hope she is all right.",0,But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department. It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday.,0
580,"Hi Bill, I saw your grandma yesterday. Oh where was that? I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track. Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy. She is always making us kids eat the proper foods.",0,"Well, it pays off for her. How old is she anyway?",0
581,"Has the train come yet? No, I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages. It’ s so unreliable. I’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week. Yes, me too. I think I’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train!",1,"Yes, my customers have started to complain too!",0
582,"I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me. What's that? I fell on the way to school, and your bike got scratched. I'm really sorry. Don't worry about it. It's not new, it already has a few scratches. Did you get hurt?",0,"No, thank you.",4
583,"That's the most important thing. It's kind of you to say. I feel a little stupid. Forget about it. When you lent me the bike, it looked brand new, almost anyway.",0,"Maybe, but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well.",0
584,"Hello, Jane. What do you do in your spare time? Well, nothing special, reading, watching TV, walking, and so on. Don't you have any hobbies, like stamp collecting or things like that?

But I didn’ t know you had experience in that line of work.,0
592,"Well, if it isn't the teacher's pet! Stop it. Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else. You can't prove that by me. I saw the score on your report. Hey, I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got.",1,It just happened to be the highest grade in the class.,0

596,What are you doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Don’ t you know what day it is? Mumm. no. It’ s only the day when the world’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off.,0,What?,6
597,"The World Cup! The first match is today! It’ s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’ s going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all. I have no idea what you’ re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl. This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals. Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’ t really appeal to me.",0,"Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they’ re really good!",0

600,The final examination will be held at the end of this month. Have you made good preparation? Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year. Are you sure you can do well this year? I am 100 % certain.,0,"According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.",0
601,What? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets? I'm sorry. I forget all about it. How could you? I reminded you just this morning. It's leap my mind. I really feel terrible about it.,5,I have been looking forward to this performance all month.,1
602,"Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business! Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me. What are you talking about? How does it exploit people? Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.",0,"Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’ t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’ t become addicted or anything like that.",0
603,I’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive. Yes. I dare say it will be. It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed. No. I don’ t think that’ s possible. Some places are sure to be open.,0,But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money.,0
604,"Mmm, you may be right. Do you think we’ ll need our overcoats? No. We couldn’ t possibly. Why not?",0,It will be summer. So it will be hot.,0
605,Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas. What did you have in mind? I don't know yet. I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap.,0,I know what you mean.,0
606,"Uh... that's Greek to me. That means they have tapered legs. Well, mine are baggy. They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in. Mine are, too.",0,So maybe we shouldn't go out after all.,0
607,"Hello, this is David. Hi David, this is Marge. Can you meet me after work for a few minutes? Sure! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office? That will work.",0,Does five thirty work for you?,0
608,"I feel like going for a drink, it's been a long day. Great idea! Peter, I could use the drink. How about the new bar across road? Sounds good. The food there is fantastic too.",4,"I agree, I had lunch there last week.",0
609,I have an idea for Christmas this year. What is it? Let's not exchange any gifts at all. You big scrooge!,4,Hear me out. We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it!,4
610,"Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes? Yes. Are you in his class? I'm thinking of taking his class next semester. He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?",0,"Yes, I really need someone who is really good.",0
611,"I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you do that? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you? No, that stuff isn't important to me.",0,Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?,0
612,"Hey, Ben... did you catch the game last night? Uh... what game? Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points! Um... and what sport are we talking about here?",0,Football of course!,0
613,"Oh... football. Football is cool. I usually try to catch the World Cup finals. No, I'm talking about American football. The World Cup is soccer. Oh, I understand. I can't say I'm a big fan. I'm from China, and football doesn't have a really big following over there. So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball?",0,"Yes, I think so. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team. Are you a diehard football fan?",0
614,"Julia, what's the weather forecast for tomorrow? It says a storm may come tomorrow. Oh! I hate rainy days! Me, too. I'm always in low spirits when it rains. Are you going out tomorrow?",0,Yes. I have to drive to Washington D. C.,0
615,"Thanks for offering to give me a lift. I'm looking forward to this party, but I didn't want to go alone. Don't mention it. It's my pleasure. Have you been to one of these large, sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven? No, this is my first. Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home. I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late. But I was the first one there. I'll bet you were a little embarrassed.",0,"You're right. The invitation said two to seven. I was there at two o'clock, but most people didn't arrive until three or four. They didn't start cooking until five o’ clock.",0
616,"Cookouts often start slowly. A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two. Thanks for telling me this. I was late getting back from the mall, but I'm hurrying. Why are you in such a hurry? They said, Dinner at eight, and it's only seven-fifteen. I don't want to be the first one there again.",0,Don't worry. We won't be the first.,0
617,"Some people are always closing their handsets, so it's difficult to inform them. Why not send them short messages? Can short messages reach them? Short messages will be kept in the short messages center. Once they open the handsets they will receive them, which is better than you can't find them.",0,Why haven't I thought of this skill?,4
618,"Hi! How are you going? Fine, thank you. How are you doing this morning? Not bad. How about you? Haven't seen you for a long time. Yes. I've been to New York. I got back only yesterday.",0,Did you enjoy yourself?,0
619,"Hello? Hi Tina, It's Joe. Hi Joe. How's the weather there today?",0,It's really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.,0
620,What's the temperature? It's 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning. Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.,0,I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.,0
621,"Hello, Ann! Is that you? Yes, it is. Hi, Tom! It's a real surprise to see you here. It's been a long time! What's new? Nothing much. What about you? Is everything going well?",0,Not bad I guess. I just got back from Hawaii.,0

623,"Tom, I've got good news for you. What is it? Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize? Really? I can't believe it. It's like a dream come true. I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize!",6,You did a good job. I'm extremely proud of you.,4
624,"Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK? I don’ t know. I didn’ t really feel like going out. I guess I’ m feeling a little homesick. Come on. We’ Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it. I was. It’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’ t be able to home because I can’ t afford the airfare. I’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’ s cooking and being around my family.",0,"Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.",0
625,"I see what you mean, but I’ m still bummed out. OK. how does this sound, let’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there! You know, I could really go for that. You don’ t mind being my wingman for tonight? Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys’ night out... well kinda...",0,"Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don’ t let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it’ s not a pretty picture!",4
626,"There are some things I miss. But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides, I grew up in Los Angeles, so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America? I'm going to New York to visit my sister. She is in art school. I've never been to New York before. I'm kind of scared. Why? Well, I know a lot of people have guns there. I think maybe it isn't too safe.",0,"Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there. She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there, she must know the city pretty well already.",0
627,"Yes, I'm not really scared. Maybe only a little. Don't believe what you see on TV. You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see? I want to see the museums, and I want to shop a lot. The museums are excellent. And the shopping! Well! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there.",0,Hmm. I hope not.,0
628,"I'm thirsty. Pull over to that store, I'll buy some drinks. I'm afraid I can't. Parking is not allowed here. Oh, that's too bad, Where can you park around here? There is a square in front of us. We can park the car there.",0,Is a shop there?,0
629,"Could you tell me what university you want to go to, John? Pardon? What university would you enter? University? Why? You asked me last year.",6,"Oh, I forget.Sorry.",0
630,"I went to Harvard University. Did you? And what course did you take there? God save me! Is there anything wrong with you? Didn't I tell you? I've not known.Perhaps, I've got a bad memory.",0,I did a B. A. in economics.Remember?,0
631,Did you have a good weekend? Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much. Oh I see. So what did you do then? I washed my car instead.,0,Ahh. And how about on Sunday? Did you watch the football?,0

633,"Here they are. Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes? Oh, no, this is the rest. Thank you very much.",4,It's no problem at all.,4
634,"I'm really curious. What is it like doing housework all day for a living? It's a little like being a mom, only I get paid for it! I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing. Most women would rather hire a maid. That's exactly why my business is doing so well!",4,How Ay clients do you have already?,0
635,"Hi, Mr. James, what’ s the rush? The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check. I can lend you some money. Thanks. But it’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set.",4,Can I help you in anyway?,0

639,"When I was at school, I was quite good at track and field events. I was on the school team for the long jump, 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin. Really? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus. I wish that I were good at the discus, but I could rarely throw it in the right direction! I was awful. With the hurdles, I could never jump over them! I thought you were good at the high jump!",0,"No, I was good at the long jump. I liked the sprints best.",0
640,How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read? How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read? He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school. Does he even know how to speak English?,0,No. But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there.,0
641,"Hi, Stephanie. I hear you have a new job. Yes, I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School. So how do you like it? Well, the salary is a little low, but the students are nice. How are things with you?",0,Not bad. You know I'm an air traffic controller now.,0

644,"well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start. what else can we do to protect the environment? if you do have to drive, you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol.

You should take your glass, paper, plastic, cardboard, and tin cans to a recycling center.",0

648,"hey, Tom, did you enjoy your lunch? oh, don't mention it. It was terrible. what ' the matter? the food station was as crowded as usual. I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich, and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone.",2,I see. You simply can't blame the server for this.,0

650,"well, I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy. i guess you're right. More often than not, people go there only for convenience. The foods may taste good, but generally speaking, they are high in calories, salt and fat. yes. I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle, don't you? you bet. Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America.",0,"well, actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places.",0
651,What's up? You look low. It's my girlfriend. I guess she's playing the army game. How come? I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again.,5,I understand that. But I think maybe it's not a date. You are taking the matter too much to heart.,0

I don't have an aspirin. Perhaps you should go to a doctor.",0,"No, no. I am okay. It's the weather. It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining.",0
655,"Really, John. I still think you should go to a doctor. You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning. Why don't you take this afternoon off? If you don't want to see a doctor, at least you can go home and have a good rest. I can't. I am already behind the schedule. Besides, you know Mr. White. He would think that I was putting him on.

I will call my doctor and have him go over. Ok?,0
656,"How's your work? Good, thanks. How about you? Not bad. But we have lost a few of staff lately. Why?",0,Because of the low salaries.,0
657,"Good morning, Linda. How have you been? Pretty bad. I’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can’ t get rid of it. I’ m sorry to hear that. Is there anything else I can do? No, thanks.",0,"Well, I hope you’ ll feel better soon.",0
658,"Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend? I'm not really into racecar driving. You were when we were in high school. That, and baseball. Yeah, well, times change. Look at you-you're a father now. You can't say that you haven't changed.",0,"True, but I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now.",0
659,"I can't believe it! I lost. It looks like you have to buy tickets for us, Jason. And we're not going to see an action movie! That's not fair, you got all the easy questions. I guess that's just the luck of the draw.",0,I want a rematch. Let's play again.,0

662,"that's alright. I notice you have a few newspapers there. Would you mind lending me one? no, not at all. Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian? I prefer the British paper, but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away. I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off, so the Guardian is all yours.",0,thanks a lot. That's really nice of you. Would you like a piece of gum?,0
663,"Man, I’ m freaking out! You gotta help me! Whoa, whoa, take it easy, relax. Geez, you’ re sweating like a pig! What’ s going on? I can’ t go through with this! I just can’ t! I’ m not ready for marriage! What was I thinking? I’ m only thirty five years old! I’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me, adventures waiting! I can’ t settle down yet! What are you talking about? It wasn’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family!",0,I know. I know!,0
664,"Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. How come? It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.",5,I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?,0
665,Who's that over here? That's the new teacher. What do you think of the teacher? She's very nice.,0,What does she teach?,0
666,"English, of course. Is she your teacher? Yes. She teaches our class three times a week. Can she speak Chinese to her students?",0,Not very much.,0
667,"Hello? Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing? Oh, hi. I was just watching TV. There's nothing to watch right now.",0,I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored.,0
668,"Me too. Let's get together and do something. I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow? Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow. Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow?",0,I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny.,4
669,That's great. We can do something outdoors then. Are there any special events going on tomorrow? Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow. Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out.,0,Do you know what time it starts?,0
670,"Would you go to the bookstore with me? It sounds a good idea. Let’ s go. Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel? Yes. I heard about that. And I know you want to buy it, but I’ m not interested in detective novels.",0,So what are you interested in?,0
671,When can we expect you for dinner? Can you come tonight? Not tonight. I promised to go to a concert with my sister. Well... How about Friday then? That sounds fine.,4,Good. Shall we say seven o'clock?,4
672,"I don’ t understand why you always look so happy, so energetic. It seems like you’ Ve got good news everyday. Really? Do I look happy all the time? All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers. Oh, do you know why? Actually, it’ s easy. Because I always exercise. My exercise, I think, is very hard. I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties. I feel alive!",0,"Oh, I know. I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you.",0
673,"Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It’ s difficult and boring. It’ s true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week. But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’ t students want to have a good memory? Of course. I didn’ t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?",0,"Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.",0
674,"Which kind of sport do you like to watch? Basketball, football, table tennis. I will watch them on TV. So you must like NBA game. Yeah, it is my favorite. Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game. I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian, the Chinese players in NBA.",0,What kind of sport do you like to participate in?,0
675,"I am good at tennis and skiing. What about you? I prefer the indoor sports, such as bowling, badminton and squash. Moderate exercise is really important for health. ' Life lies in movement. ' How about playing tennis with me?",4,Good idea. I will take the racket.,4
676,Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get started using these machines? Of course. Are you a new member here? Yes. Welcome. My name is Johnson.,0,Nice to meet you.,0
677,"Do you have any experience using weights? No, I don't. So I need some help. Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines. Yes, I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready, I think. I can start using the machines.",0,Alright. Great. Then we must get a card for you.,0
678,"What do you mean--a membership card? I already have one. No. Not that. I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here, let me show you. I'm ready. Now, you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So, when you go through the series of twelve machines, you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine.",0,I see. So this card helps me to keep track of my progress.,0
679,"Yes. And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today, I will go through the machines with you one by one. I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you. Alright. Great. So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then, after you exercise each time, you file the card here. Great. Why don't we start on the machines?",0,Are you alright? Can you do more?,0
680,"I'm sorry. I know there are still seven machines. But I'm exhausted. That's okay. Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself. Especially not at the beginning. What can I do though? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines. We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now, it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back, then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks. Right?",0,Yes. I suppose it's best to stop.,0
681,"what are you doing? I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle. Whenever I get the time, I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper. you really like brains that make you think, don't you? I guess you could say that. What kind of games do you like?",0,I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at!,0
682,"Doesn't everyone? Which games are those? Well, I like to play darts. Whenever I go to a bar, I usually play for a few hours. Did you play a lot of games when you were little? My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes. We used to have family tournaments every weekend.",0,Do you still like playing those games?,0
683,"Not at all. I never really did, to be honest. What about you? Did your family used to play games together? Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games. Some of my friends play cards on the internet. Have you ever tried that? No, I prefer to play with people I know.",0,How about mah-jong?,0
684,Can you believe that Susan got married? Really? I remember she said if she would remain single. Is the man very rich? No. That’ s what is surprising me. You means she didn’ t marry a rich man.,0,He’ s a postman.,0
685,"Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Sit down, please.How are you? I'm very well, thank you.How are you? Very well too, thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day?",4,"Yes, it's beautiful, but it's also very hot.",0

688,"We've got a new manager in our department. Oh? You hoped to get that job, didn't you? Yes, I did. I'm sorry. That's too bad. Who is it? Who got the job, I mean?",0,"Someone called Drexler. Carl Drexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job, too",0
689,"Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you? Because I'm the wrong sex, of course! You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman? Yes, that was probably it! It isn't fair.",1,What sort of clothes does he wear?,0
690,"A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why? Perhaps that had something to do with it. You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater? It's possible, isn't it?",0,Do you really think I should wear different clothes?,0
691,Well... perhaps you should think about it. Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress? I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all! Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing!,1,Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. But it isn't. Not in this company.,0

694,"You keep bowling spares but no strike. I don't know why, but I think there's something wrong with my hands. I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball. I don't think it was the problem with your hands, you did several excellent spares. You have no problem with your hands. Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball?",0,"The problem is you are too nervous. You want to have a strike so much, so you deliver the ball too hard. And when it comes to the I second roll, there's no pressure. That's why you could bowl all those spares.",0
695,Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon? No I'm afraid not. I'm meeting Ruth then. How about the fourteenth in the morning? I'm sorry. I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then. What about the next day?,0,No. I'm busy then too. I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road. Are you free on Thursday afternoon?,0
696,"Hi Jackie. You don't look too well. What's going on? It's nothing. I'm just a little stressed out. Why? What's stressing you out? School. Since I was working part time, I had a difficult time keeping up with class. Now that we have exams coming up, I'm totally freaking out.",3,The best thing to do is study as much as you can. I'm sure you'll do alright.,0
697,"The new webpage design is much more effective than before. I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format. Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page? I thought the old page wasn't half bad... The old page was okay, alright, but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume, because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect. Now it's different. We got our marketing department team in on the action, and the results are smashing... What changes were made from the old page to the new page?",0,"First, the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information. They can sign up for a free monthly drawing. Once we've got their info, it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting. Also, there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services, so as to give confidence to new customers. We also added a specific area for on-line customer service... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback...",0
698,"Pardon me. Could you please pass me the tissue? Sure, here you are. Thanks, I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy. Are you ok? Yeah, I think the food is alright, it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, you should have known better.",0,"Well, not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies.",0
699,"Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while though, I got used to the taste, and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy. Yeah, you can increase you tolerance for spicy food, but so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes. I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, but when you have no other choices, you've got to adapt. Yeah, I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome, do as the Romans do. '",4,Exactly.,0
700,"Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted? Yes, at first I felt very awkward. After Bill was demoted and then resigned, it was kind of like somebody died! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something. And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to... Did they mutiny? Thankful, no. I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career. I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor. After a couple weeks, it was like nothing happened.",0,It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them.,0
701,"Are you feeling better today, Bill? Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit.",0,But you should make up your mind first.,0
702,"Hi, John, how was your vacation? Awesome, we went to Australia and New Zealand. That must have been wonderful. Do anything interesting? Well, we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia.",4,Wow! Isn’ t that dangerous?,0
703,"A little, but the rush was worth it. Tell me about it. We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us. 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.",6,"Yeah, It was scary, but exhilarating.",4
704,"Hi, Tina, it's Joe. Hi, Joe. What's the weather like there today? It's really cold. It snowed all day and the school closed early.",0,What's the temperature?,0
705,It's 20 degrees below zero now. It was even colder this morning. Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow? I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow. I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.,0,Me too. How's the weather where you are?,0
706,"Mom, I just finished my paper. Can you proofread it before I hand it in? Sure, let’ s take a look. Sweetie, this is terrific. Your ideas are so original. Thanks. I can tell you worked hard on it.",4,I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago.,4
707,"Merry Christmas! Huh? I said Merry Christmas! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here? It is? Oh, that's nice.",0,Huh? Didn't you know? Aren't you excited?,0
708,"Actually, I'd forgotten about it. Forgotten about it? How could you? Because I'm not Christian, I'm Jewish. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.",0,It's all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian.,0
709,"Bill, Happy Halloween! Happy Halloween! What creature are you going to dress up as? I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs. May I have a look at your costume?",0,Sure. Wait a moment. ( Several minutes later ) Here you are.,0
710,"Hey, Karen. Look like you got some sun this weekend. Yeah? I guess so. I spent the weekend at beach. That’ s great. Where did you stay? Some friends of my parents live out there, and they invited me there.",4,"So, what did you do out there? I mean besides bask in the sun, obviously.",4
711,"I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down. Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming? I wanted to, but the water is too cold, and I just wetted in up to my knees. It all sounds so relaxing. I wish I could get away to the beach like that.",4,It looks like you could use it. Don’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.,4
712,"OK class, so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class, today we will review everything we have learned. Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is? The brain! That's right, the brain! It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition. Then what major organ is in our chest? The heart!",0,"Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food?",0
713,"The stomach and intestines! Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything? Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder! Oh yes, you are right. Very important organs indeed.",0,"So what do these organs do, teacher?",0
714,Linda? Is that you? I haven't seen you in ages! Hi George! It's good to see you! What have you been up to? I just opened up my own business not long ago.,0,Good for you! What are you doing?,0
715,"So, what’ s new in the kitchen? That refrigerator is new, isn’ t it? Yes. I needed a large one. Before, I had a separate refrigerator and freezer, but this has both combined into one. That’ s usual nowadays. You’ Ve added a few shelves too. Yes. You know I’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients.",0,Did you buy new cupboards too?,0
716,"No, I didn’ t. I gave them a really good clean, so they just look new. The worktop was in poor condition, so I had a new one added. I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils. Yes, I have. I need them to help me with these new dished I’ m trying to make. I need a little more practice before I invite guests over. Looking at the spice rack, I’ d say you’ Ve been learning how to make asian food.",0,"Yes. I’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food, so I’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries. I’ m pretty good at making curries now, but I still need practice at making thai food.",0
717,"How do you like skiing, Pat? I love it. All my life I wanted to learn to ski. Finally I took lessons last year. I suppose skiing is easy for you. No, quite the opposite. I thought I'd never stop falling down. Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better.",0,I see. Do you ski often?,0
718,"Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night. That sounds great. Oh, yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski? Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg",3,Don't be so frightened. It's just a skill.,4
719,"Hi, Dave. This is Zina. Zina? Zina the Snake? I got your e-mail a couple of months back. Yeah? Which one was that?",0,"The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.",0
720,"Hello, my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight. Yes, what can I do for you? I need to cancel that. We have had a last minute change of plans. I see. Would you like me to reschedule you for another night?",0,"OK, we will let you know as early as possible. By the way, will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation?",0

722,"Can't you wait till you get home? then you can surf the internet using the broadband, wireless connection or whatever you like. No, I'm not feeling myself. I just want to check my emails, visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends. Now I see, you must be suffering from discomgoogolation. What does that mean? there's nothing wrong with me.",0,"Well, the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google '. Because floods of information are just a mouse click away, net users are very likely to become addicted to the web.",0
723,"Sally, I’ m tired of this Western food. I really miss my mother’ s Sichuan cooking. I’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking. But can’ t you try to get used to Western food? I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much. I suppose you’ re right, Lee. Maybe that’ s why so many Westerners are overweight.",0,"It’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy.",0

729,"Which one is that? You know, the one just on the corner with Oxford Street. There is a large pharmacy next door. Oh yes, I know which one you mean. I have never been there, but I looked at their menu once and it did look good. Okay then. I think we will all meet outside?",4,What time?,4
730,"Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school? No, I was way too busy studying all the time. How about you? Yeah, I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant. What was that like?",0,It was always very busy there.,0
731,"Why is the long face? I'm getting sick of work man. I can't take the political bull in the company any more. Did you just get your review or something? Yeah, but that's not why I am upset.

743,"Alice, your father is amazing. He’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. I know. He doesn’ t like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself! That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent. It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.",0,They see their independence as a kind of character strength.,0
744,"Happy Birthday, Mary! Thank you. Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it. What a lovely dog! How did you know I love this?",4,I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.,4

747,"Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth. That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life. That's what my father tells me almost everyday. Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me.",0,Thanks. I'll let him know.,0
748,"Wedding rings! Oh, no... Aren't they cool? I like the settings. Jen, is there someone you're not telling me about?",0,"No. I just like looking at wedding rings, OK?",0
749,"Hurry up, get in. I’ m in, let’ s go! OK, make a left here... no wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up! Geez! What’ s the rush?",0,"Don’ t worry about it, just drive. Oh, no, the light is about to change... step on it!",0

What’ s your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help! Here, I know a short cut... just go down here, and we’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let’ s go, let’ s go! Watch out for that lady!",0,I’ m going as fast as I can!,0
751,"I've heard so much about Japan. Is it a beautiful country? Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful, but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France, don't you? Yes, I do feel the same way about France. The swift rivers, the fertile valleys, the large cities-its scenery is beautiful. Will you describe the geography of Japan? Well, it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands. France isn't an island, is it?",0,"Oh, no, France isn't an island. It is located in the western part of the European continent. But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts. Does Japan have good harbors?",0
752,"Good harbors! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world, and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world. Also, there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands. France isn't very mountainous, is it? No, France isn't very mountainous. But it does contain the Pyrenees, a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons. What kind of Climate does Japan have? The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south, mild in the central part and cold in the north. Except for Hokkaido, we don't get much snowfall at all. France has a mild climate, doesn't it? Yes, the climate of France rarely has severe winters. In southern France, one can live in comfort the whole year. Is Japan good for farming?",0,"Yes, Japan is good for farming. Rice is the main crop, but Japan is also an industrial center. Fishing is very important, too. Rice isn't grown in France, is it?",0
753,"Hi, why do you look so depressed today, Mike? I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday. How come? It is a long story. Basically, she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't.",5,I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood. But why not take it easy?,4
754,"Diana, in your opinion, which is more important, IQ or EQ? Why are you asking me the strange question, Jerry? I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night. And the question just lined in my mind. Well. I think IQ matters more. But it won't work without EQ.",0,Why? You seem pretty sure about it.,0
755,"Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life. But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it. That's why people's achievement varies greatly. That ' s true, but what if one comes across some difficulties. He must rely on his EQ to deal with them.",0,"Yes, Jerry, can you share your understanding of EQ?",0
756,"I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives. Quite right. Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success? Just as Forrest? Yes, his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ.",0,I got it.,0
757,"Come on! It's time to go! Wait a minute! Just hold your horses! What's your hurry, anyway? Well, I've got to stop and get gas in the car, first. That won't take long.",0,"Well, it won't if there no line at the pump.",0
758,"Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I’ m picking the film, because I don’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick. Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything. Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous. and it’ s so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back. I’ m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’ re always so negative.",0,I’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.,0
759,"You see, that’ s what I’ m talking about, I can’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings. Well he’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories. Love stories? More like one-night-stands.",0,"Don’ t criticize Mario or else I’ ll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours ; they’ re no saints.",1
760,"Which language do you speak? Well, I studied French at school, but I’ Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents? Yes, I do. I’ m learning Chinese now on the internet. How do you find studying a language on the internet?",0,"It’ s not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn’ t too good.",0
761,"I bet you find the character difficult to write! Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they’ re easy for me. So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right? Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?",0,"In a way, it’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.",0
762,"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? Sorry, I thought you knew. But you should tell me you were in love with her. Didn't I?",0,You know you didn't.,1
763,"Well, I am telling you now. Yes, but you might have told me before. I didn't think you would be interested. You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?",1,"Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.",0
764,"So, did you go out with Richard? Yeah. We went to a movie last Saturday. We saw Police Partners II. Did you like it? Richard did, but I didn't. Of course, I told him I liked it.",0,Yeah. So did you do anything else?,0
765,"Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation? I think I will continue my studies. Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree. We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market. So you will continue to study for a master's degree? Well, I think so. But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree. If can get a Ph. D. abroad, it will be much easy for me to get a job at home.",0,How can you finance your education abroad? It is very expensive to study abroad.,0
766,What a great weekend that was! My feeling's exactly. I really enjoy the beach in the summer. I couldn't agree with you more.,4,We should come here more often.,4
767,"I think Andy's party will be fun. Yeah, I think so. Oh, by the way, I need to ask you something. What's that? Could I get back the sweater you borrowed?",0,"Sure. Oh, that reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots?",0
768,"I went to Super Junior's concert last night. It was fantastic. Really? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now. I am also a big fan of theirs. Yes, their new album just came out last week. It is number one on the billboard. I really love their dancing. They are all excellent dancers.",4,"The lyrics of the new song are beautiful, too. Can you sing?",4
769,"I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. If you would like me to, I could help you with that. Wouldn't that take you away from your project? I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.",0,Is there a good time for you to help me?,0
770,"If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready by Friday. How about meeting in my office? That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have. Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.",4,Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!,4
771,"If you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese? Why? Did tom pop the question? Not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parents’ consent. Let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right?",0,You are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I’ m between a rock and a hard place.,0
772,"I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex. Oh, how did you deal with it? I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up. Oh, it’ s a pity. What was the matter?",0,Simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.,0
773,"Like what? He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family. Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first. Yes, he said it would be better for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.",0,So that's why it’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.,0
774,"Hi, Ann. Hi. You look excited. What's happening? I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days. And you're planning to enter?",0,Of course. This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice.,4
775,"Is there a prize? I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio. Do you think you have a chance? A chance? Not just a chance, I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful.",4,But you haven't practised all that much.,0
776,"What day is today? Today is Thursday. What's the date today? Today is May first, 2003.",0,"Oh, today's International Labour Day. Is it our working day?",0
777,Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday? That would be fine. Where are you going? We plan to go to a forest in the suburb. There is a beautiful river there. We can do some fishing. Great.,4,And don't forget your fishing tackle.,4
778,"Daniel, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school now? The same question to you. Well, we shall make it a secret between us. Deal, Where is Gucci?",0,She is the cheer-leader. They are required to put on a performance. Look! Here they come.,0
779,"Oh, look at her. She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA. I want to be like her. Get real. Don't be so pathetic. Hey, young man! I'm your sis. Don't talk to me like that.",0,"Oh, man, look at her, go! She is amazing! She should be my sis.",4
780,"Boy, you've got such a crush on her, haven't you? Yes, I want to be her boyfriend. Just like in the movie. Are you out of your mind? She told me she liked my new haircut. She thought it was cool.",4,"Go ahead, have a try and be a joke.",0
781,You know John? Which John? Mr.Turnbow’ s son? Yes. I’ Ve read news about him in today’ s paper. And he’ s bright and intelligent. I’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam.,0,I wish he could too.,0
782,"Good morning. I want to apply for a library card. Give me 10 yuan, your ID card and a photo of you please. But I hear that the card is free. Yes, it is. But you must pay a deposit for the card.",0,"There will be a refund when I return the card, right?",0
783,"May I invite you for a dance? With pleasure. You dance well. Do you breakdance? Me, what brought that on?",4,There's a story about breakdancing in the paper.,4
784,"What does it say? According to the story, it's some sort of modern dance style. Like disco? Well, breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance.",4,And disco a kind of nightclub.,4
785,Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place? It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. Do you need it for the whole weekend?,0,We will need it for both days.,0
786,"We will need to know who will be driving the van. The van will be driven by Mary and me. It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that? Oh yeah, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom.",0,Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.,0
787,Guess who I saw yesterday? I don't know. Who? Avril Lavigen! the Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?,6,"yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, her poster, a CD...",0
788,"so you're a big fan, eh? not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer, too. and she was in a movie once again, right? yes, though I don't think her acting skills are that great.",0,what was your impression of her when you saw her in person?,0
789,"Can you lend me fifty bucks? What? Again? Why do you keep running out of money? I guess I don't earn enough. No, I think it's how you budget your life, that's the problem.",0,"That's my business, not yours.",0
790,"True enough, until the time comes that you need to take my money. I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important. So how do you survive from pay day to pay day? I don't just survive. I put money away as well. I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go, and I stick to my plan. If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises. I'm not disciplined enough I guess.",0,In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies. I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits.,0
791,"How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved? I think that the public transport system could be made simpler. I never know where the bus routes actually go. The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line. I think we just need to build more roads. Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we’ d have fewer traffic jams. If we built more roads, people would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars.",0,How would you do that?,0
792,"I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, they won’ t use their cars as much. I don’ t know. I think it’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, for example. I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes. The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular.",0,"That’ s a good point. Car owners will probably be against it, but people who use public transport will be in favor of it.",4
793,"You’ re new here, right? Yes, I am. Will this be your first year? No, I transferred here.",0,What school did you come from?,0
794,"I transferred from PCC. Why’ d you transfer here? I wanted to attend this school originally, but my grades out of high school weren’ t good enough. Is PCC a good school?",0,PCC is great!,0
795,"The bridegroom looks a bit nervous. On this occasion, most people do. Oh, they are playing the wedding March. Here they come. She is a beautiful bride.",0,I am so happy for them.,4
796,"Are you crying? Yes, I always cry at weddings. Harris and Anne are perfect for each other. Yes, they are.",0,You and Tom also make a great couple.,0
797,"Jessica is going back to Holland next week. I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift, but I still have no clue. is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with? yeah, that's her. We had a lot of wonderful times together. She is really a special friend, and I want to get her something meaningful. I am not good at picking gifts. Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier?",0,I don't think so. That way it would lose all the charm. I want it to be a surprise. I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last.,0
798,"yeah, that's nice. hmm, I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home. a plant? That's creative. I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you. But there is a problem. Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs? I hope so. I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase. I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.",0,I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer. You don't want to get her in trouble.,0
799,"Have you got your invitation yet? My invitation? No, I haven't. My invitation to what? The house warming party. Whose house warming party is it?",0,Tom and Bill Smith. They are both working now you know? And they've bought a new house.,0
800,"Oh, they have? I didn't know. I haven't seen Tom lately. It's out in the suburbs. Have you seen the house? Yes, I have. I went out with them last weekend.",0,Is it nice?,0
801,"Yes, it is. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, and a big kitchen. There's also a garden. Well, that does sound nice. Have they moved in yet? They are moving today. Tom's taken the day off. He's rented a truck, and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight. When are they going to have the party?",0,Next Saturday night. You should get your invitation today or tomorrow.,0
802,"Have you ever been to Xi’ an? Yes, I’ Ve been there several times on business trips. But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city. I’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring. I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day. Of course I won’ t miss the local food either. You know, the sites interests a food in scenery, food is a key factor when visiting a place. I agree. As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects. That is frightening.",0,Sure it is. Is it convenient to get there by plane?,0
803,"Tomorrow is Sunday. Let's go out and get some fresh air. I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei. Are you interested in going there? why not? I love animals and I love nature. You can see many cows and horses there. lf you are brave enough, you can try horseback riding. it is fun.",4,sounds very interesting. I can't wait to go there.,4
804,"Wow! It is huge and you can do many activities here. That is true. Some people go camping, some people pick fresh fruit, some people go boating and some people go grass skiing. I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm. Well, now you know. Let's go to the lake over there. Some people are fishing over there. I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake, I really want to try.",4,I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first.,4
805,"Yes. we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake. Who do you think will catch a big fish first? Of course. I will. Wait and see. I want to try horseback riding after fishing. It looks very exciting and fun. It is. However, you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider.",4,No problem. It is always worth trying something new once in your life time.,4
806,how are you doing? I'm ok. I wish I could say the same for my friend. what happened to him? he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving.,0,was it his first offence?,0
807,unfortunately not. He was charged with a DUI when he was in university. what happened to him then? not much ; it was a minor offence back then. He got away with a fine of $ 500. did they take his license away?,0,"no, they were really easy on him. The problem is that that was a long time ago. They are much tougher on crime now.",0
808,"what do you think will happen to him? well, he'll definitely lose his license, pay a fine, and maybe even spend some time in jail. that doesn't sound too promising. Does he have a defence lawyer? not yet. If we can't find a lawyer for him, then the state will appoint him with one.",0,my sister is a lawyer. I can ask her if she can help him.,0
809,"Well, sir, we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant. Is that so? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie? I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie. Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment?",0,Certainly.What time will you come back?,0
810,"Want to meet for lunch this Saturday? Sorry, I can’ t. I’ m busy. What are you doing? I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month.",0,What kind of volunteer work?,0
811,"Tom, is Jenny crying? Can you take he away from me? I’ m just coming for that. She kept on bothering me.",0,She’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can’ t you be good to her?,1
812,You’ re making my blood boil. Calm down. Madam. I'm about to explode! You’ Ve made a mess of this matter. I am very sorry to hear that you’ Ve been having so many problems.,0,Sorry isn’ t good enough! What can you do to help me?,1
813,"Can you tell me something about financial aid? What exactly? How to apply for it? In your first letter, that is, when you apply for admission, you should also tell them you need their financial aid.",0,Then...,0
814,How was Mei’ s party on Saturday? Oh I didn’ t go. I stayed at home with my family. Oh really? What did you do? We watched lots of television and films.,0,I see. Anything else?,0
815,What's the temperature today? It's about 5 degrees centigrade. What's the weather forecast for tomorrow? The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow.,0,Are you used to the climate here?,0
816,"I think I'll soon get used to it. What is the average temperature of Beijing? lt's about 180C, but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero. And we have a long winter. Which season do you like best?",0,I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice.,0

You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, a big school or a small school, a public or private school...",0
821,"I’ m trying to decide what school to apply for. Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? I’ m not sure. What’ s the difference between them? Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.",0,Which is better?,0
822,"Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class. Is this something that you could schedule for another time? No, I have to do this ; it's important! Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you?",0,I've made arrangements with a friend to help me.,0

825,"The air quality in this city is horrendous. The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again! Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment. On top of that, there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs, which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city. As much as I love this city, I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in. Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health.",0,"I know what you mean. However, there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming. If it's not the pollution, then it's the natural disasters, deforestation, or the greenhouse effect.",0
826,"What is the greenhouse effect exactly? It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. I see, so it's similar to global warming? They're related to one another, yes.",0,I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live.,0

837,What's your favorite book? It's Gone With the Wind. Why do you like it best? I enjoy the various characters and the plot.,4,Well. I like the Thorn Birds best.,4
838,"Is it very interesting? Sure. I like the writer's language, too. If I have a chance, I'll enjoy the book. Would you like to go to the bookshop with me?",4,That's a good idea. Let's go!,4
839,"May I help you? I would like to check out these books. May I see your library card, please? Yes. Here you go.",0,"Apparently, you have unpaid late fees.",0
840,I do? You owe some money. Exactly how much do I owe? You owe $ 24.50.,0,I won’ t be able to pay that right now.,0
841,"How did you choose courses when you were abroad? That's a very good question. Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal. In order to do these wisely and effectively, you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor. Wait a minute. There are some new terms for me. I can hardly follow you. Ok, I will go into more detail. A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation. You can discuss with him the program selection, changing or adding a program, the requirements for graduation, and other problems related to your study. You will choose some courses, and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation.",0,Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there.,0
842,"So it is hard to be a black student on campus? Yes, in many ways it is. There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life. Stereotypes? Like what? Well, like since I'm black, I must like rap music, come from the inner city, or play basketball well.",0,"I do know you like rap music, but the other two are definitely false. I’ Ve seen you play basketball.",0
843,"Hey! But that's not the only problem. There's also the affirmative action stigma. You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota? That's not true at all, you're really a smart guy. I know that, but some people don't think like that. And I get problems from teachers as well. Teachers? I didn't think that they would be racist at all.",6,"Racist? Not exactly. It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic, as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject. Suddenly I become the representative of the black race, as if we all had the same opinion.",0
844,Could you help me? What do you need? I can't seem to find my class. What building is it in?,0,It's in the C building.,0
845,"Oh, I know exactly where that is. Do you think you can tell me where it is? Sure, what room number is it? It's room number 261.",0,I have a class around there right now.,0
846,"John, have you ever watched Beijing Opera? Yes, I watched once. What do you think of it? Well, honestly speaking, I went to watch it out of curiosity. I'd say it's really a special art form.",0,"I couldn't agree more. Actually, I'm a Beijing Opera fan.",4
847,"Let’ s play a game! OK! How about Scrabble? No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I’ m going to describe someone’ s face, and you guess who it is! OK!",0,"Let’ s see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!",0
848,"Hi Julie, how are things going? Everything is great, Tad. How are you? I'm doing really well. Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?",0,"Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?",0
849,"That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee. I thought that he was with Malia. Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday. I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!",4,"Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.",0
850,"So, Emily, how was your day? I don't think you really want to hear about it. It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it. To be honest, it was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck!",1,Why? What happened?,0
851,"Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! That's not very fair. What did you do? There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired for me for sure. Does he treat everyone in your department like this?",0,"He treats everyone pretty poorly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake!",1
852,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company? Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.,0,That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders.,0
853,Can you speak English? Yes I can. I speak it very well. Where did you learn it? I lived in England when I was a child.,0,What else can you speak?,0
854,"Hi, Maggy, Did you hear about David? About David, No, I didn’ t hear anything. You know, about David and new boss. Sorry, I don’ t quite follow you.",0,"Well, I hear David have been fired.",0
855,"I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza, but the price is very high, I really can't afford it. How much is it for each square meter? How large is the apartment? It's 7500 yuan per square meter, and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room. Its total area is about 80 square meters. That surely will cost you a lot of money. Are you going to make a full payment?",0,"Do you think I am rich enough to make it? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments. The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment, I can move in at once.",0
856,I really like the record you lent me the other day. I'm glad you like it. And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long. Not at all.,1,I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it.,1
857,"We'd like to have a look around your house? Yes, of course, please follow me. Thank you. This is our courtyard.",0,"It's so spacious, about 40 square metres, right?",0
858,"Yes, about 46 square metres. Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch? Yes. Very beautiful and very interesting. But why do you hang them in the tree?",4,"They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them, so they hung them in the tree. Then in winter, they can peel corn ears in their leisure time.",0
859,"So, where are you going to spend your winter vacation? Oh, I’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand. You have a girlfriend in Thailand? Interesting. How come I have never heard of that? Actually it will be my first time to meet her.",0,"You mean you haven’ t seen her before? Then, how could she be your girlfriend? Maybe you don’ t even know her.",0
860,"Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is today! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there! What a perfect day to be at the beach! The kids are going to have so much fun! And we’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they’ re playing. It does seem like the perfect day! I’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather! This looks like the perfect spot! Ok kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp. Here, Mary, help me lay down these beach towels. There we go. Can you help me with the umbrella? Perfect. Ok kids, here’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel. I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don’ t stray too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.",4,And stay in the shallow area. I don’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar! It’ s too deep out there and we didn’ t bring your floatier.,4
861,"Hello Hi Angela, it's Dan. Hi B. How are you? Good.",0,I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?,0
862,"Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off. No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You're still coming to the wedding with me, right? Oh, is that next week? Yes. Did you forget?",0,"No, of course not. I already bought them a present.",0
863,"That's good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, can you tell her for me. Sure. Does she know your friend? Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I'm not exactly sure how they know each other. Are we all going to drive together?",0,"Yes. I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get Megan.",0
864,"Hey, look at the offer I got in my e-mail. It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home! Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy? What do you mean? I mean that you're gullible. You shouldn't believe everything you read, especially on the Internet.",0,But it seems like a good idea. All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter. After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money.,0
865,"Sounds like a pyramid scheme. Have you heard of those before? Pyramid scheme? What is that? It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy, like a pyramid. The person at the top asks the people below him for money, and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him. Sounds good to me. The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him.",4,"Not exactly. The scam keeps on going, with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom.",0
866,"We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning. What do you say we take a break and listen to some music, okay? Now that you mention it, I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop, too. Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine. While you're picking out a record to play, I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator. You sure have a lot of discs here.",0,"Yeah, I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff.",0
867,"When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner? Next Saturday? Next Saturday? I’ m sorry. I’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter. How about Sunday then? Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time?",4,"Does 6,30 suit you?",4
868,"I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains. I agree, I think that that would be perfect! I was thinking it could take place sometime in January. That might be a little too cold for some people.",4,"Yes, you are right.",4
869,"What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot. Yes, that would work out better. You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone. Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.",4,"Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!",4
870,How may I help you? I need to check these books out. Do you have your library card? Here it is.,0,It appears that you have late fees.,0

872,"Merry Christmas! Huh? I said Merry Christmas! Don’ t you know that Christmas is almost here? It is? Oh, that’ s nice.",6,Huh? Didn’ t you know? Aren’ t you excited?,6
873,"Actually, I’ d forgotten about it. Forgotten about it? How could you? Because I’ m not Christian, I’ m Jewish. Oh, I’ m sorry. I didn’ t know.",0,It’ s all right. There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I’ m Christian.,0
874,"Welcome, young man. No offence, but I haven't seen you here before. Of course, this is my first time here. My Mom has a membership here. Here is the card. Okay then. You are the younger customer here ever. It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market.",0,"It's the marketing's fault, I suppose.What do you want to do?",0
875,"Well, I want to become just like Bruce Lee. What should I do? That's a long way to go, I'm afraid. First of all, you gotta grow up. I am still young. And I'm growing every minute. Sure. Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope.",0,I love running. Anything else?,0
876,I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members. Really? Can I join it? Of course you can if you like it. How can I join it?,0,There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday. You can apply for it then.,0
877,"What do you do in summer? I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride. I love being out in the fresh summer air. How about you? I don’ t often go for walks, but I either play sports outside-you know, tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book. What do you do in winter?",0,"Well, I play sports indoors quite often. If I’ m feeling lazy, I just watch a film at home. I prefer summer to winter.",0

881,Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most? I think housing is a big problem. There are thousands of homeless people on the streets. How would you solve the problem? I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.,0,It would probably be very expensive.,0
882,"I think the government can afford it. Besides, there are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i It’ s not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly. If we are to invest more money to education, we will need to raise taxes. That wouldn’ t be popular with voters. Most voters what everything both ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, but without increasing taxes.",0,The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.,0
883,"Would you like to see our new shirts? Sorry, but I’ m not really that interested in those things. Well, they are very nice you know. Really?",0,And not expensive either.,0
884,"Oh, I don't care about that. Everybody is buying them. Are they? Yes, they are very fashionable, you see.",0,I am afraid I am not interested in fashion.,0
885,"Come in, come in! Hi, Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn’ t you meet me there? I thought we were supposed to meet HERE. Don’ t you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn’ t make sense to meet at the apartment.",1,I’ m sorry. We must have misunderstood each other.,0
886,"how was school today, Dominic? I hate school! why? What happened? I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today!",2,it's just one exam. Can you re-take the exam?,0
887,"yes, but it's so humiliating! I don't want my friends to know I failed! why didn't you do a good job? I don't know. I sat down in my seat, looked at my paper, and then my mind just went totally blank. do you think you studied enough for the exam?",0,no...,0
888,"what did you do last night? I watched TV. did you study at all last night for your exam? no, not really.",0,"I am sure if you had studied, you would have done well. When can you re-take your exam?",0

890,"What? Not my Dad, I hope!? Come on, Mary, it's your brother, Jack. No kidding! Jack is such a log! He's never dated a girl. The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him.",0,And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls. He's putting his heart into his stamp collection.,0
891,"How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth? At least, it is better than my boxed lunch at work. I'm so fed up with the bland food. Thank you for having lunch with me! Any time. But I don't mind eating boxed lunch. The food sanitation is really good too. It's hard to believe that you like it. You are so easy to be satisfied.",0,"Hey, it's not that bad. The food is nutritious and it's really convenient. I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff.",0
892,"Eating is important. You are what you eat. It's not only a daily routine. Well, will you just go back to work after lunch? No. I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch. But you didn't eat anything today.",0,"Well, the bill is paid by month. That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant.",0
893,"All right. I'm going to the McDonald's. For what? I thought you didn't like western food. No, I never did. It's for my son. He loves it, and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week. That's really smart. My son Daniel is the same with your son. I just don't get it, why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food.",0,"Me, either. But, it's for sure that the children market is a really big one.",0
894,What can I do for you today? I need to return a book. Can I do anything else for you? I want to check these books out.,0,Is that all?,0

A few people like extreme sports, but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them.",0
897,"The weather is terrible. Yes. It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now. I'm wearing my heavy jacket. I'm going to put on more clothes, too.",0,Will it snow today?,0
898,"I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country. Have you heard of motor coaching? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry. No, I've not heard of it. Tell me about it. It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land. Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach.",0,Is it just a bus?,0
899,My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon. Can you tell me something about it? Certainly. It’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year. What happens on the holiday? Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate. Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year.,0,Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday?,0
900,"Rachel has decided to quit smoking. Really? Why? You never guess she is going to have a baby. Oh, it's unbelievable. She is such a chain smoker.",6,"Yes, yes. She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby.",0
901,"Do you know who’ s just got married? Old McDonald. Never! He’ s over 80, isn’ t he? He’ s nearly 90. Good gracious! Are you sure?",6,"I am. What’ s more, his wife is 84.",0

903,"Mike! What's going on, man! Long time no see! Hey, Pat! Yeah, I haven’ t seen you in ages! How is going? Things doing great! It’ s funny running into you like this. Smell well, just last week I ran into Matt as well. Yeah? How’ s he doing?",0,He’ s doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.,0
904,"Hey, Jack, where's your car? I got rid of that clunker. This is my new one. Is that right? It sure beats the old one? Jump in, I'll give you a ride.",0,"Ok. Boy, this looks expensive.",0
905,"Yeah, it costed a bundle alright. Wow, this's sinking a hole. Yeah, this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned. I believe it. Hoo, this car corners like it's on rails.",0,We are on the high way. I'm the * *.,0

911,We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? no idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights.

913,"Look, here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty. These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty. How can you tell the difference? From what I see, they look almost the same. The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it, while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period. Look carefully, and tell me if you see the difference now. Yes, they are different! But it's too professional. What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake. Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin?",0,Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins. We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines. We can judge it with naked eyes.,0
914,There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow. It's the fourth one this year. Isn't it horrible. Yes. We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading. It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees.,0,But we need the wood.,0

The exchange rates are eating into our profits, and we can't do anything about it. It's really frustrating, isn't it? I have the same problem.

I haven't spent anything, it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate.",1,"What we really should be making investment in is the Euro. I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter, I think it's about time to buy in.",0

Unlike you, I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand. I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin. Come on.

922,I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach. Just do whatever you feel like doing. ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy. Let's put the stuff under the tree.

930,"How was the party last night? Did you enjoy it? Oh, don’ t talk to me about last night! It was the most awful evening I’ Ve ever had. Why? What happened? Well. Mary had promised to be my date, but she stood me up. I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind.",0,What about the party?,0
931,"Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff? Let me see. Laptop, flash disk, a ballpoint pen, a pencil, a notebook, a pair of glasses, cell phone, charger, moisture, notion,... Oh, that is too much. You are not going to a business trip.

I carry it all the time.,0
932,Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year? Because they are full-grown. Look at their curvy figures. I feel they all talk and behave in a different way. They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys.,0,Some even do make-up slightly. Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently?,0
933,"This one looks great! I love the seashore. So do I. The sun... the sand... the ocean! And listen to this! What do you think of sailing, swimming, windsurfing, and fishing? Oh, Tom! They sound fantastic. I really like all those things.",4,"Yeah... me, too.",4
934,"May, look, what's that in the cage? Don't you know that? It's panda. Of course I know. I just can't see it very well. OK, then put on your glasses, and do you know what does the panda eat?",0,"Of course, Bamboo!",0

936,"John, did you have a dream when you was a little boy? Of course I did. I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up. But unfortunately, I didn’ t realize it. I had the same experience with you. When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist. But now you see, I'm just a common office clerk. Okay, forget about that. S, do you have some practical dreams at present?",0,"I do. And now I'm working hard to learn English, and I want to be an interpreter some day.",0
937,"Hi Joe. You've met my new assistant, right? Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. You are kidding, but she's so helpful. Tom... you are her boss, you down. Of course, she's helpful to you.",0,Come on. She's like that with everyone.,0
938,"Eric, how long will you be in China? I don't know. Well, my contract here is for one year, and I don't know what I should do after that. Maybe going around for a while. Well, have you ever thought about learning some Chinese? Actually, I am learning that now. But it's too hard for me. You know the four tones and the stuff. It really freaks me out.",0,Don't worry. All things are difficult before they are easy.,0
939,"You hit the nail right on the head. Well, are you invested in some language-exchange program? What is it? It's where I teach you Chinese, and in exchange you teach me English.",0,Awesome. I've been giving this a lot of thought. When can we do this?,4

944,"Hey, Leo. How come you look so terrible? What’ s going’ on? You can say that again. Susan’ brother dropped in from out of town, so I offered to put him up for a few days. But he’ s driving me up a wall. This guy is bottomless pit. How gross! I can’ t handle people like that. Does he at least give you a hand around the house? He doesn’ t lift a finger! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon.",1,"Man, what a freeloader. You better do something quick or he’ ll never hit the road. After all, he’ s got it made in the shade here.",0
945,"David, why didn’ t you clean the room? I’ m not in the mood. Why are you feeling depressed? I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me. That’ s a real let-down.",5,I don’ t think she will do such a thing.,0

947,"what question? Do you love me? come on, I’ m eager to hear. you know that I care for you. I---I’ m proud of you. Don’ t cherish your words, dear.",0,I---I don’ t feel like saying it.,0
948,"Hello, this is the admissions office. Can I help you? Hi. I’ m calling about your continuing education program. What would you like to know? I want to become certified in computer programming. Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education?",0,"Yes, we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects.",0
949,"Marquet, do you think I should enroll in the science course? Yes, I think so. If you want to graduated this year, you've got to take a science course. Right, I figure since you are doing premedical, you know about the very courses. Well, I have to take biology, chemistry, maps and physics. What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.",0,"Yes, I'm really weak in maps, I did poorly in high school.",0
950,"Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think. After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year, I have really been able to make bank doing something I love. Is that right? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet. How can you be sure your idea will cash in? To run a successful internet business, it requires a little research and relatively small investment. You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular. That's marketing research... But what about getting started once you have an idea?",0,"After you have your great idea, then you can set up shop by registering a domain name, creating a website, an email address, and a hosting service. If you want to go all out on your website, you can put together shopping cart technology, but that can be pricey to start out with.",0
951,"You went out on a date last night, didn't you? Yes, I did, but Linda stood me up. She didn't keep the date for the first time. How come? I don't know.",0,Why don't you phone her for a date again?,0

Say, next Wednesday evening?",0
955,"Hi, my name is Lean, and I'm from Russia. Nice to meet you, Lvan.My name is Alike. I'm from Japan. To me English is a difficult language. A second language is always difficult.",0,"True, but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language.",0
956,"May, is this the Hall of Ancient China? Yes. Look at these historical relics here, amazing! Why are they all in glass boxes? For protection. Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air.",0,So there isn't air in the glass boxes?,0
957,"No, there isn't. There is a vacuum in every box. I wonder how old these things are. Thousands of years? Yeah, they all come from a very ancient time. Hey, look at the tripod. I've seen it on TV.",4,"It was made 4,000 years ago. It's priceless!",4

Why are all these clothes on the bed? I don’ t know what to wear! Ok, give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I’ ll wear these as well.",0,Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants. It’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat.,0
959,How may I help you? I need to return these books. Give them here. Here they are.,0,It appears these books are two weeks late.,0
960,"I forgot they were due. You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees, right? How much is the late fee? The late fee is 25 cents a day.",0,So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late?,6
961,"Hi, Robert. What happened to your face? It looks swollen. I had to go get a cavity filled today. Did it hurt? I don't even wanna talk about it. It killed me!",0,How long were you in the chair?,0
962,"It took quite a while, but the worst part was getting numbed. They had to give me 3 shoots. Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, huh. You have to take good care of your teeth. No kidding. Not only can’ t I stand the pain, but man... dentists are expensive. The bill is going to be humungous! Don't you have a dental insurance?",0,"I do, but it still does not cover everything.",0
963,"OK, guys. Here's the plan. Get the ball to the goal, and keep it away from Rich and Taylor! Why? Are they good? They played ball at school. Here we go. Yi-jun, go out for a pass! I'm ready!

Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world.",0,"The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water. Compared to the oceans, most countries are tiny.",0
965,"Well, I can’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week, and they did not even call us in advance. John, they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside. That’ s their custom. I know, but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us, and without warning. Don’ t your relatives visit other relatives?",0,"Yes, but Americans never visit without calling in advance, and they almost never stay overnight.",0
966,"Oh, George, what a beautiful day it is today! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there! What a perfect day to be at the beach! The kids are going to have so much fun! A It does seem like the perfect day! I’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather! This looks like the perfect spot! Ok kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca There we go. Can you help me with the umbrella? Perfect. Ok kids, here’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel.

967,"What do you think about studying in the U. S.? Well, for many international students, coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience, especially when finding a house on campus or off campus.

But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now. Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer.",0,That is not true. They are just jealous of him!,0
970,"Jordan is a legend, anyway. An idol that no one can replace. I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player. He is not just about muscles he also plays smart. You know what, he is also an outstanding football player. He is surely to be a star of tomorrow. By the way, do you know if he has a girl friend? You are so not here! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders.",0,"Oh, My chance is slim then.",0
971,"How do you usually get to school? I usually ride my bike. Which form of transport do you prefer to use? I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle, but when I feel lazy, I drive my car. I think we should discourage people from using their private cars. They produce too much pollution!",0,"I agree, but I would find it difficult to stop using my car. It's just so convenient.",0
972,"Cars might be convenient, but they're so bad for the environment. Do you have a car? No. I used to have one though. Once I started using my bicycle to get around, I found that I didn't really need it. Maybe if I sold my car now, I wouldn't be so tempted to use it.",0,You could try. It would save you a lot of money.,0
973,"That's true. Every month, I spend hundreds of dollars on gas, insurance, and repairs. If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving, you will get lots of exercise, too! I could stand to lose a few pounds. Having a car has made me lazy. I never end up walking anywhere! Let's go to a car dealership. I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price.",4,Sounds good! Let's go!,4
974,"How's your new work, Carl? A tough job. They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon. Good for you. I don't like it. I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours. Above all, I hate talking to those poker faces everyday.",0,"Well, you have to take the bad with the good.",0

The subway was so packed this morning, I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work. At least the subway is better than the bus. It's faster for one thing. And usually less crowded. But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus. It adds up over time, if you take it every day.",0,"That's true. The bus is even worse. Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired! Hey, how do you get to work every day?",0
978,What he said disappointed me. What did he say? He advised me to change to a more suitable course. Why?,6,He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women.,0
979,"What do you think is harder, reading or writing? Well, they’ re completely different. Reading is passive, and writing is active. I don’ t think I understand what you mean. Could you explain a little more? In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are. In writing you have to produce language, you have to create your own words on a blank page.",0,"Oh, now I see what you mean. When you’ re reading, you are just looking, but when you are writing, you are actually doing something!",0
980,"A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge. Don’ t you think so? I think I see what you mean. I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can’ t write it. Exactly. So I have another question for you. What do you think is harder, speaking or understanding?",0,They’ re both harder than reading or writing.,0
981,You look happy. I am happy. I just bought a new car. Wow! Is it a good car? It’ s a great car. It’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast.,4,Was it expensive?,0
982,"Professor, do you have a few moments when I could meet with you? I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you? Three would be a good time. Great, do you need directions to my office?",0,I'm not sure.,0

984,"Bill. Bill! You gotta help me! What’ s wrong? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack. Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven’ t bought my mom anything! I’ m such a bad son! Take it easy! Let’ s go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like.",0,That’ s just it! I don’ t know what to get her!

988,"what are you listening to? Is that Beethoven or Mozart? it's Beethoven. Do you like it? I think Beethoven's music is incredible. I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent, too. Do you believe that? I don't know about that, but I do think that it helps people relax.",0,what other kind of music do you listen to?,0
989,"actually, I mostly just listen classical music. What about you? to be honest, I think classical music is too complicated for me. what kind of music do you prefer then? I like pop music. Do you?",0,not really. I don't think pop music has much depth.,0
990,"I see what you mean. I think that's way I like it so much. how long have you been in to pop music, then? I've always been into it. Have you always liked classical music? not really. When I was little, we didn't really listen to music at all.",0,"so, how did you become interested in it?",0
991,"Want to join me for a midnight snack? I need to grab something to eat. Fine with me, but no more chafing dish. Let's go to the food stall. There's a good one just around the corner. I'd love to try some snacks.",4,( Later.. ) Everything looks tempting. What do you want to have?,0
992,"Can I help you, sir? Yes, I've been sitting here for a few minutes. I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car. I'm sorry, sir. But this is the self-service pump. Self-service?",6,Yes. You must fill up the car yourself.,0
993,"Are you serious? Yes. Are you traveling here? Yes, I'm from Taiwan. I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car. In America, most gas stations are like this.",0,Do I really have to do it? I don't know how.,0
994,"Oh, no. It looks like my computer really has caught a virus. Why? Did you open an attachment? Yes, something called “ George W. Bush. ” An hour later, all I see are pictures of George W.

995,"Millions of amateur investors like you, have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers, magazines and commentators to get investment information. Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day. It's like information overload, not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines. Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts?",0,"Well, for example, The Wall Street Journal is very, very good. Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin.",0
996,"I like to read Fortune. Good. Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid, too. Where does a broadcast company get most of their information? I hope it's not just from press releases. A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting, talking to people at the stock exchange, fund managers, analysts, etc.",0,"But sometimes when a flimsy report, or even a rumor gets on television, there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect.",0
997,"Hi, Li Ming. You look upset. What's the matter? There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it. Why? We can leave school earlier that day.

We are gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.",0
999,"Aren’ t you interested in watching the Olympics? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world. I just don’ t find it very interesting. I think it’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event. I think that for a lot of people, it’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries.",0,I think the Olympics help to promote world peace.,4
1000,"You have a lovely house, Jack. Thank you. But a number of things have been going wrong lately. That's too bad. What problems are you having. Oh, the whole house needs re-painting for starters. The carpet in the living room is worn out, and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting. Last week, I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet. Anyway, all par for the course when you own a house, I guess. I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over.",0,I’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby. Could I make some suggestions?,0

1005,"I see! Do you want to ask her out? Sure, but how? You can ask her out for drinks after work. But for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.",0,Then you've got a lot of work to do. You need to get her to notice you first.,0
1006,Easier said than done. You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her. But I always get tongue-tied when I see her. That's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased.,0,I see. I'll try.,4
1007,"i saw lily for the first time. and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams. i have a date with her on Friday, but i really can't decide what to do. what about taking her for a dinner or a movie? not bad, any other ideas? well, there is a play on campus this weekend.",4,good idea. that ' s why i think i have culture. you have any other suggestions?,4

1011,"I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball. You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand. I couldn’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down. Not to mention cooler. Did you go swimming? I wanted to, but the water is too cold, and I just wetted in up to my knees. It all sounds so relaxing.

I’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative. And there’ s only one place to find a children’ s book in the neighborhood. That will not always be the case. And it was yours. And it is a charming little bookstore. You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year.",0

1263,"So, you friend’ s getting married on Saturday. What have you bought her as a wedding gift. I find is so hard to choose the right gift. My friend and her fiance had a really good idea. They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook. The picture are of things they want. People sign their name by the item they will buy. That’ s clever! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift. What things were in the notebook? Most of the things were household appliance. You know, everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker. I think it’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home.",0,"So, what did you get them?",0
1264,"I bought a sewing machine. I know that my friend likes making her own clothes, but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems. What’ s wrong with it? She says that after several years of use, it’ s not working properly. When she uses it, it makes a funny noise. Household appliance don’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays.",0,"I think it’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models. Because they know that we will buy the new models, the appliances don’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most.",0

1266,"well, it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America. It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. I think you'd like it. it sounds interesting, but I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth. I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, with hilarious results. really? that's interesting!",6,"yeah.Oh, here it comes! why don't we watch it together? they are going to have a court debate in this episode. It should be good.",0

I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that’ s it, right?",1

Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc. Well, that seems easy enough. Wait, there’ s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea. Geez. Is that all?",0,"Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!",0

1270,"At first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going. That's interesting. How often do you write a blog? It's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, and if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks. Got it. Are you still updating your blog?",0,"Sure, since I came back from the US, I've been keeping the habit of blogging, simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like.",0

1277,"ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ', A / S / L is tricky, which is often used at first encounter. It's a three-word question, ' age, / sex / location? ' Interesting. Then what does H & K refer to? The city of Hong Kong? Wrong. lt's not a place name, but a passionate act. Really? What kind? A girl left this word to me, and I thought she was in Hong Kong.",6,Ahahah... you miss her point for sure. H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss '.,4
1278,"why are you in such a good mood today? well, yesterday, I decided to face my fear of heights. I didn't know you were scared of heights! Was it really bad? let me put it this way.

Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO. Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot. He actually is the CEO now, or will be, as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with. Yikes! you are joking, right? I can't believe it. No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately. I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments. What big shoes to fill! No kidding! When the last CEO left, we were worried about the future of the company.",0,"What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, but what does he actually do?",1
1282,"Okay, can I ask you something direct? Ha! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush. Fair enough. Give it to me straight. Did she bully you into this? No, seriously...

1375,"Let ' s got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend. I don ' t think that ' s a good idea.

You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first. ”,0
1376,"What? Come on! That’ s just lame! No girl would fall for that! Fine, then you can say, “ So there you are! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams! ” That ' s a good one!

1382,"Do you like swimming? Yes. Swimming is one of my most favorite sports, indoors or out-doors. Me too. Swimming is a very good exercise for health. It combines water, bath, sunbath, and air bath together. It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles, bone, viscera and nerve systems.

If so much attention weren’ t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.",0,"You can’ t compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can’ t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.",0

And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile.",4,You seem excited about it.,0
1386,"Well, you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team. Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there. Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first.

1463,"Hey, what's up? Oh, nothing. What were you writing? ( Laugh ) All right. You caught me in the act. I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out. I was just writing a note to put on her desk.",4,You mean you're going to ask her out in a note? You big chicken!,0
1464,"I admit it. I'm a wuss. I just can't do it in person. But, you work with her everyday. That's different. When I'm working, I'm in a different frame of mind. But, when I even think about asking her out, I get tongue-tied. At least in a note, I can get the words out without turning beet red. You've dated a lot. What's so different about Diana?",0,"Well, for one thing, she's gorgeous. She's so upbeat and sweet. Who doesn't like her? Oh, I don't know. All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together. But, what if I'm wrong. Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way. Oh... forget it. This was a bad idea.",4
1465,"Well, I guess you don't want this note, then. What note? I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana. She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night. You're kidding! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything.",6,"Sorry. What can I say? Now, do you want the note or what?",4
1466,"So, what happened? He never came. He stood you up. I wouldn’ t exactly characterize it in that way. I think something happened. Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to... what if he showed up, took one look at me and left?",5,Not possible.,0
1467,"Maybe, there was a subway accident. Absolutely. A train got trapped underground with him inside. And no phone.",0,"And you know, how those express trains create suction.",0
1468,"Mary, how was your date with john? It's OK. It seems we have a lot in common. Oh, really? That is great news. What does he look like? He is tall and slim, fair-haired.",4,Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?,0
1469,"He is a nice guy and very considerate. I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor. Oh, it's love at first sight. When will you see each other again? He didn't say, but he said he would call me. Maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!",0,"Oh, David. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What should I do if he doesn't call me?",0
1470,"Do you know much about computers? Not a great deal. I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now. For accounting system and things like that, you mean?",0,"Yes, but they are used for other things, too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.",0

1475,"OK, that’ s fine. Bye. What happened? That’ s it, my lease is up. I have to move. What? Why? Can’ t you renew it?",6,The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot,0
1476,"Well, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP. I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while. Well, let me know if there’ s anything I can do to help out. Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?",0,Hehe.. sure,0
1477,Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most? I think housing is a big problem. There are thousands of homeless people on the streets. How would you solve the problem? I have a good idea to solve it. The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes.,0,It would probably be very expensive.,0
1478,"I think the government can afford it. Besides, there are many advantages. Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address. They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement. It’ s not a bad idea. I think education is the biggest problem at the moment. Schools don’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly. If we are to invest more money to education, we will need to raise taxes. That wouldn’ t be popular with voters. Most voters what everything bout ways. They want the government to pay for lots of things, but without increasing taxes.",0,The government should show that it is using money efficiently. Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project.,0
1479,"Hello, Joanna. You are looking very charming in the new dress. Thanks. Does it suit me? Yes, it suits you very well. It certainly is unique. I don’ t think I’ Ve seen anything like it before.

1480,"Welcome back! How was your vacation? It was fantastic, but I'm glad to be back! Being a tourist is really tiring! Where did you end up going? Because it's off-season, we got a really good package deal to Paris, so we went there.",4,I've always wanted to go to Paris. The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world! Did you go to the top?,4
1481,"That was the first thing we did. I have a few pictures. Do you want to see them? Sure. What's this one a picture of? Oh, that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling. I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city. You don't look very happy in that picture.",0,"No, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces!",0
1482,"So what did you do? We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel. My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre? Of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though.",4,That's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day.,4

She must be thirty years younger than Leo. Talk about robbing the cradle! Well, you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan.",0,It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week.,0
1486,"How many credits are you taking this semester? I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant. But so far, I only have fifteen. What's the matter, are the classes you want full? Yes. And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major.",0,"If you were to take on a double major, what would be your first choice?",0
1487,What part did you get in the play this time? I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes. I wish I had a character part. Those are my favorite. Are you kidding? You got the leading role.,6,"I know, but I've done that so Ay times. It's getting old. The leading guy is always the same macho A.",0
1488,"Great party, isn't it? Yeah, really, jane and ted always have great parties. This is my first, I only met jane last week. she and I teach at the same school. Oh, so you're a teacher.",0,"Yeah, history, what about you?",0

1493,"Anytime before 6 pm tonight. Ok, Nathaniel. I'll have Ms. Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm. Thank you! Bye!",0,bye!,0
1494,"Dan, Dan, dude. You have to come over to my house right now! Is everything OK? Just get over here! Come in! Quickly!",3,"So, since when is your house a bank?",0
1495,"What do you mean? I mean, what’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows. Security, Dan, security! You can never be too safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window. What’ s the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?",0,"Paranoid? I’ m not paranoid! I’ m cautious! You see Dan, we have to be on guard at all time! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you! Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank!

This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages. It is about a happy family without sex, violence or bad language. I know that. I have seen the film as the same title. Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess.",0,"Yes, you are right. I like the song in the movie, edelweiss, do you remember it?",4
1501,"Of course, it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant. Those young actors play the roles perfectly. I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie. Have you bought the tickets? No, I am asking you whether you will go to see it.",4,Let's go. We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant.,4

1511,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?",6,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
1512,I'm sorry for being late. You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over. About what time can I go to my own class? When everything is over.,0,Now that it is all over. can I go now?,0

1514,"That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby? That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings.

1519,"Do you think children watch too much Tv? I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day. I don’ t think that tv is bad for kids. I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes. Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch. They don’ t do much else in their free time. At least they always do their homework first. If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch, remember to have something else for them to do.

It happens almost everywhere.",0
1524,"I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight.

I don’ t believe it. I am not exaggerating at all. I’ m telling you the truth. That was how I felt at that time. Yes, perhaps. Chinese usually don’ t notice that sort of thing.

1527,"Now that you'recommending such enormous fees, producers, directors, movie-makers must see you in a completely different light. Yeah. Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed. Well, if that's the case, I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have. I can only do what I know, and live how I've lived all my life, because I'm a fairly stubborn person.",0,It seems to me that now you're famous. You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties.,0
1528,"I don't go to parties. The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house. Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in. I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen. Then fans don't see you much in public places. Yes. I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life. I love what I do and I love how I spend my time, which isn't in a public place. A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts.

1532,"No. you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection. There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city. So, what programs do you have on your laptop? I’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs. I know you are keen on photography.

I would like to buy some candies. Since there are so many people, I think they must have delicious candy.",4
1538,"Look at the candy bar over there. It is so colorful and tasty. They have lollypops, chocolate drops, fruit candy, mints, pearbrittles and toffee. They are in different colors and flavors.

I think he appreciates that. Really? Yes.",0,"But I am new here, and I'm not sure he is used to that.",0

He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women. I am very happy to hear that, Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company.",4,"I agree with you on that, Annie. I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now. I feel he appreciates his employees for their work, not their gender. I would never change jobs.",0

1552,"seriously? But you are such a genius. maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure. well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ. you can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks.",0,"oh, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming?",0
1553,Hey Sarah. Why are you limping? Oh. Hi Matt. I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches. Was it your first time? Yeah. And I never want to go again.,5,"I remember the first time I went. My back was sore, I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt, and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast.",0
1554,That's exactly how I feel now. It's only like that the first couple of times. Ha. There won't be a next time. You gotta give it a chance. It's fun after awhile.,0,"I'll think about it after I start feeling better. Right now, I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding.",0
1555,"Hi Mark. Oh, hi Stacy. How was your summer vacation? I worked over the summer at a restaurant. Have to make tuition money, right? What did you do?",0,I took summer school. I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up.,0
1556,"So are you officially a junior now? Yeah. And I have 5 credits to spare. I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer, but I took 15 because the price was the same. That makes sense. So where is Nicole? She dropped out of school completely.",0,Really? Why?,6
1557,"She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well, they asked her if she wanted to work full time. Wow. She's so lucky. She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job. It sounds good now, but I'm traditional. I want the degree, so I wouldn't have accepted the offer. Do you know how much they are paying her?",0,"I don't know. But I bet it must have been a good offer, or she wouldn't have accepted it.",0
1558,"Are you a smoker? Yes, I’ m afraid I am. My husband is a smoker too. Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker? No. But my husband smokes 20 or more a day.",0,When did you begin to smoke?,0
1559,"Jenny, you look terrible. What's eating you? Don't brother me! Hey, chill out, I'm just trying to help. Sorry, Sally, it's not your fault.",5,"So, what's the problem?",0
1560,"I drew a blank on the algebra test. No kidding! Didn't you study for it? Yeah, but nothing was clear during the test. That's too bad, anyway, I'm sure things will turn around next semester.",0,I'm thinking of dropping out.,5
1561,"Lisa, I'm home. How was your day? Pretty good. I've made a few friends already. Anybody I know?",0,"Well, Pam Franklin lives next door to us. By the way, can I go to her house this Saturday?",0
1562,"It's nice and bright today, isn't it? Yeah. The autumn is marvelous here. How about winter? That's a hard time. The air is cold and damp, and the road is often icy.",0,"It's boring, right?",0
1563,Sure. Do you get much rain during the summer? Plenty. We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area. So you should bring an umbrella often.,0,That's right.,0
1564,"Thank you for coming to see me off. Not at all. If have time, I'll come again. You're welcome at any time.",4,Thank you for your hospitality. I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay.,4
1565,"May I invite you to dance with me? Sorry, I can't dance. Never mind, I can teach you. Is it difficult to learn?",0,"No, it is easy.",0
1566,"How should I do? You just follow me. All right. By the way, do you often dance? Yup, because dance can relax myself.",4,It seems a good way.,4
1567,"Hmm, what should I wear today? Come on, you think about what to wear almost every day. There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe. Well, haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe? I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you.",0,"Loving to look beautiful is women's nature. In fact, I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today.",0
1568,"What do you think of the way people use and treat animals? I think most people treat animals well, but we are often cruel to animals. When we raise animals for food, the conditions they live in are often poor. Perhaps people should stop eating animals. We could grow more crops. What would you do with all the animals? You couldn’ t just let them go. Besides, some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.",0,We could provide them with better conditions anyway. We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos. We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible.,0
1569,"That’ s true. I think zoo are a good idea, because they allow people to get close to animals. I think it’ s good for kids to see wild animals. I agree. I’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo. I don’ t like animals experiments though. I believe that we can do tests in other ways. I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced. That’ s good news. The good thing is that most people treat their pets well.",4,"Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals, but those stories are rare.",0
1570,"Do you object to drinking black tea, Mr.Zhang? Yes, that is why I never drink it. Do you drink green tea, then? Very seldom, because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health.",0,"But if the tea is good and well prepared, it will do much good.",0
1571,"What good is it for? Not only can it appease one's thirst, but it can also refresh one when tired. That's true, but it must not be allowed to stand long. Why is it so?",0,"Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before, it will do you harm.",0
1572,"Jennifer, would you like to have dinner with me? Yes. That would be nice. When do you want to go? Is today OK? Sorry, I can't go today.",0,How about tomorrow night?,0
1573,Ok. What time? Is 9:00 PM all right? I think that's too late. Is 6:00 PM OK?,0,"Yes, that's good. Where would you like to go?",4
1574,"Hi, long time no see. How have you been? Oh, I've been fine, but I'm having some trouble with my son. Tell me all about it. Oh, he's 14 and in the past few months, he's become quieter and a bit secretive. He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd.",5,"Oh, I see. What makes you think that?",0
1575,"Well, he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band. And one night last weekend, he came home really late, way past his curfew. Really? What happened? He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home. I see what you mean. I understand why you're concerned. Have you tried talking to your son about it?",0,I haven't yet. I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through.,0
1576,"Hello, Tom! Do you have plans for this evening? Nothing special. How about having dinner with me? That's great. I would love to. And when?",4,"Let’ s fix it at seven o'clock, OK?",4
1577,"Hello Mei, How about going for a meal this evening? Good idea! I finish work at five. Why don’ t we meet at six? Ok that sounds good. Where shall I meet you? Let’ s meet in front of the train station.",4,"Ok great, I’ ll see you at six.",4
1578,"I'd like to meet you again sometime. That would be great. Actually, can I get your phone number, Ella? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime. Anytime. You can reach me at 5558929. Ok, got it. I will call you sometime next week.",4,Fine.,4
1579,"Lisa, I'm so glad to see you. How are you doing? Fine. I miss you so much, uncle Benjamin. Me too. We haven't seen each other for years. It's been 3 years now.",0,How time flies! Now you are a college student out of a little girl.,0
1580,"Hey, That's a really nice outfit you have on. Why, thank you. I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not. I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said. Oh, you look stunning. Your dress really goes well with your shoes. I'm glad that you think so. I thought it might be a bit too revealing.",4,"No, not at all. It looks really classy on you. Where did you pick that up?",4
1581,"I got it on sale down at the department store. When did you go there? I was just there a couple of days ago. You know, you should go down there too. They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale. I might just do that. What style of clothes do they have?",0,Anything you want. They have both casual and formal styles.,0
1582,"I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection. That's a good idea. Some of your ties are pretty outdated. Well, I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made, so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties. Anyways, are you going to the party tonight?",0,"Yes, I am. Say, are you going to wear that outfit to the party?",0
1583,I don't think so. It is a little too formal. I'm probably going to wear something more laid back. Me too. I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans. I guess that you will really be dressing down. That's my style when I'm not in the office.,0,Good point. I suppose that we all have our own individual styles.,4
1584,"Hello, John. How are you? I'm fine, thanks. And you? Very well, thanks. Nice to see you again. I haven't seen you for a long time. What have you been doing lately? Oh, nothing much really. And how is everything with you?",0,"Fine, thanks. I've been busy lately.",4
1585,What have you been doing? I've been studying for my exams. My school exams will begin next month. Really? Good luck for them. Thanks. And how are your parents?,4,"They're both very well, thanks.",4
1586,Where are you going now? I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me? I can't. I have to meet someone. It's been nice talking to you.,4,Good-bye. See you again sometime.,4

No, tell me more.",0,"Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week.",0
1590,What's your favorite kind of music? Do you like pop music? I like almost all kinds of music. But I like country music best. There was a concert country music last week. I wish I had been there!,0,"I like it, too. But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music.",4
1591,What can I do for you? I am returning these books. What did you do to this book? I accidentally ripped the cover.,0,You will need to pay for the damage.,0
1592,How much do I need to pay? I’ m going to need $ 5.00. That’ s not too expensive. It isn’ t.,0,Here’ s the $ 5.00.,0

1594,"How is your business on the Internet, Steven? Don't mention it. I lost a bunch of money on it this year. I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy. I am sorry to hear that. It shows that you should buy companies, not ideas. I changed my strategy around too. I am investing in good companies now.",0,"Yes, I agree with you. I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon.",4
1595,"It's a good idea. But please be careful when you invest this time. Yes, I will. I should learn more from you. After all I am green hand on it. If you have any question, you can ask me. OK. My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now. I am leaving.",4,All right. Let's chat next time. Bye-bye.,4

1598,"Now I understand. But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here? You can buy some of these nice butterflies. No, I'm sorry. I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting. What? You feel sorry for the butterflies?",0,"Yes. I think they should just let them fly free, and not try to sell them to foreigners. It is a kind of destruction of nature.",0
1599,"Well, I agree with you. I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains. I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population. Who knows? Hey, I like these jade bears here. How much are they? This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother. What do you think?",0,If you want. Didn't you buy her a small vase already?,0
1600,"Hi, Monica, I got big news. You got a raise? Not really, just take a wild guess. You got promoted?",0,"Well, it is not going to happen so soon, I guess.",0
1601,"You’ re a big fan of Andy Lau, aren’ t you? Yes, I’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD. I adore him. He’ s my idol. How come you don’ t have all of his films on DVD? Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, especially the ones where he only played a bit part.",0,I see. I’ m sure you’ ll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.,0
1602,"Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday. Are you a member of his fan club? I was, but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, so I’ m not a member now. Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?",0,Of course! I bought two copies.,0

1605,"The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition. He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned. Really? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent. What did you think of it? I liked it. I didn’ t think his works were masterpieces, but the certainly weren’ t uninspiring, in my opinion. I don’ t think I’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic. He doesn’ t seem to like anything. Which kinds of paintings do you prefer?",0,"I like landscapes and still life. You prefer abstract paintings, don’ t you?",0
1606,"Yes, I do. I like painters who use will rather than watercolors. The colors appear richer. What do you think? I agree. I prefer oils too. I collect landscapes, but I only have a small collection. You have a small collection of abstract art, don’ t you? Yes. Good artwork is very expensive nowadays. When I was in china, I bought some calligraphy by famous artists. You should come and see it sometime. That would be nice. Can you read the characters?",0,I know what the characters on the paintings mean. I think Chinese characters look very artistic. It’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist’ s character.,0

1608,"Hey, Tom, I want to learn how to play golf. You're really sporty! I want to do everything I can. Do you have clubs?",0,No. Can I rent clubs?,0
1609,There are clubs for beginners. It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times. What kinds of clubs? Like the seven-piece set. It's only $ 120. I'll buy a set. But you have to teach me.,4,Okay.,4
1610,"You are married to a foreigner, aren't you? So what's it like? Well, in the first year of our marriage, we had great difficulties in getting along. The things that are important to me are not important to him. We had a lot of conflicts. Yeah, I know what you mean. The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples, not to mention two people from different cultures. Now we have a two-year-old boy. We're very happy that he's healthy and smart.",4,"Oh, so he's half Chinese and half American. That's unusual. What languages does he speak, then?",4
1611,"How do you do, Mr.Smith? This is Lili. I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday. I enjoyed it very much. You're welcome.

It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning.",0,What section does it have?,0
1613,"You must like negotiating a lot. People are saying, you are a super negotiator. Ha, I am flattered. Actually, when it comes to negotiate, you don’ t need to like it. You just need to understand how it works. I am not good at it by any means. Give me some advice. Well, generally speaking, if you want to change someone’ s mind or understand his position, you have to put yourself in his shoes. Understand his need and the cost for his need. And then you work together to find a solution.",4,Sounds easy. But how can I apply to practice? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill. But I am afraid our boss will turn me down.,0
1614,"Hey, Shirley. The party has been wonderful. My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much, and me too. I've said you will enjoy your life here! I surely will.

1615,"That's good! Look! Who is that guy on the stage? Oh, my God! That's my husband, Benjamin. Really?",6,"He likes American Idol very much, and he always imitates the contestant at home. I can't believe he got on the stage himself.",6
1616,"He performs very well. He is so funny! OK, just ignore him. I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community. After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family! OK, that's perfect! By the way, is there any playground in our neighborhood? Yes, there is one behind our building. And you can play tennis there.

Have you been to their live shows? Yeah, it's really a unique experience. It's a solo concert by Pavarotti. He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing.",4,I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song.,4
1618,"Besides, speaking of classical music, we should never forget about the New Year's Concert. Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, or listen to it on the radio. Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show? Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005.",4,"Wow, you are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.",4
1619,"That's for sure. You know, it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever. Who was the conductor at that event? Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, he just celebrated his 75th birthday. So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future.",4,"The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, music is transnational.",4
1620,I really need to find a parking spot. Are you looking for a space on or off campus? Do you know any spaces on campus? You can park in the student parking structure.,0,Where is it located?,0

1622,"Ok. Let’ s look at our short presentation on China. What do we need to include? We need to talk about the size of the country and its population. Ok. China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion, making it the latest country in the world by population. It says here that most of the people are han Chinese, but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population.",0,We need to say something about the geography and climate of china. Is there any way to divide the country into sections?,0
1623,"We could divide into five parts. There’ s the northeast, which is mild in summer and very cold in winter. Then there is the northwest, which is largely desert. Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate. The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts. One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer. Then, in the south it is hot most of the year. That sounds very general. It is, buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation. We can select cities from each part and give data for each one. One from each part? Lhasa, Urumqi, Harbin, shanghai, and hongkong. The capital city is Beijing, right?",0,"Yes. The other large cities are Chengdu, Dalian, Wuhan, tianjin, shenyang, Chongqing. Hongkong and Guangzhou.",0
1624,"I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. Really? Are you sure? Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

1625,"our company is going to do some cutbacks soon. really? Where did you hear that? I met with the supervisor just this morning. I don't know, but I am a little worried. Who do you think will get sacked? I'm not sure... well, first, it couldn't be George. He is such a kiss-ass. He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked.",0,"no, it's not going to be George. I don't think it's Andy either. He is involved with the boss's sister in-law. And you know how whipped our boss is.",0
1626,"that's true. What about Lisa? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her. Lisa? No way. I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair. You know rumors can't come out from nowhere. well, okay. Then there is still Michael. But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row. It definitely won't be Michael. no, that would be crazy. But then who will it be? Oh dear, it must be me. I should have known it! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing. What should I do? I've got a family t",5,"well, it could be me too. But I am not too worried. This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning. It would almost b",0

I have three older sisters, my twin sister, a younger brother, and parents. I didn’ t know you were a twin! Are you identical or fraternal?",0,"We’ re identical. I mean, we look exactly the same, but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else.",0
1633,"Interesting. It must be great having a twin sister. Are you best friends, too? We used to be really close, but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai. How about your family? You didn’ t mention to your biological father. I don’ t know much about him. He died when I was just a baby. Even though I don’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother, I consider them to be my real family. What about your step-brother’ s mother? Does he keep in touch with her?",0,"No, she also died when my step-brother was little. My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends.

I suppose she's right.Does she speak English very slowly? Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said.",0,It must be interesting to study English.,0
1642,"Excuse me, Professor. I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done. What happened that you didn't get it done? I had to watch a football game instead. Well, you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?",0,"Yes, I think so.",0
1643,"Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in? I'll make it up next week. Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class. OK, I can do that.",0,"Remember that you are in college now, not high school.",0
1644,Will you be done doing my hair soon? Give me a little while longer. How much time do you need? There you go. How do you like it?,4,I think it looks gorgeous.,4
1645,You think it looks nice? I honestly think it looks great. Thanks. I'm glad that I did a good job. How much is it for my hair?,4,Just give me $ 55.,4
1646,"Why do you look so gloomy? What are you looking for? My dissertation. I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now. Did you finish typing yesterday? Yes, I kept on typing it until midnight, but it is lost.",5,Don't worry about it. It must be somewhere in your room. Let's see where you put it. Have you searched your drawers and the desk?,0
1647,"Yes, but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk. How about the shelf? I've searched everywhere. Where on earth did I put it? Don't get upset over it. At least you have another week to go.",0,I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another. Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing. How could I do such a thing?,5
1648,"how come you're still up? Shouldn't you be asleep by now? I've been having a hard time sleeping lately. as far as I know, insomnia is usually caused by stress. Are you stressed at all? well, I'm really worried about my grades. I didn't think this course would be so stressful.",5,you're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.,0
1649,you're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time? taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress. I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying! you need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn’ t very usually effective.,0,you’ re right. I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class.,0
1650,"Before we begin eating, I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan. What is it? It's a Taiwanese puppet doll. It's huge!",6,Yeah. They're usually this big.,0
1651,It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys. Yeah. Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together? I have found myself a date mate.,0,You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun.,4
1652,"Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee. It's strong. OK, OK, this is good. Keep talking. What about cappuccino and all those other drinks? Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth. Froth?",0,"If you want something manly, stick with the espresso.",0
1653,"Hello, Tom. How do you find the dinner of yesterday? Very good. That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten. It's nice of you to say so. I really appreciate you for having invited me.",4,"Don't mention it. You know, we’ re old friends.",4
1654,"Thank you for your letter. Is your waist any better? Yes, I’ m feeling very well these days. I’ m glad you are getting better.",4,And I was glad to receive your letter.,4
1655,"What are you doing, awake? I can't sleep... But it's almost midnight! Exactly. I'm too excited for Christmas morning. Also, I thought I heard Santa.",0,Really? How do you know it was Santa?,0
1656,"Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies. I even left out some milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs! Hmm... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, spying on him! Really? Really! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed. That way, we can let Santa do his job. Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already!",0,O-K...,0
1657,"Hey Eve, how are you? I’ m fine, Celia. And you? I’ m ok. I’ m so busy! Do you have a lot of homework?",0,Yes. Don’ t you?,0

1659,Yes. We must have the same exam tomorrow! Do you want to study together? Sure. This library is too quiet though. Do you want to go to and empty classroom?,0,That sounds good.,4
1660,"Are you ready to go the concert? Yes. Should we go there by bus so we aren't late? Actually, why don't we go there by bike? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour. That's true. Cycling is good for our environment, too. Let me just get my helmet then.",4,Is your helmet comfortable?,4
1661,"Not really, but I liked the design, so I got it. Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better. I'll think about it. Is that your new bicycle?",4,"Yes, my father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?",4
1662,"It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive! Nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky. I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it? Well, my saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?",0,That's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.,0
1663,"Oh, God. It’ s late. I’ m afraid I have to leave. But you just got here. Can’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea? That’ s very kind of you. But if I don’ t go now I’ ll miss the last bus. That’ s too bad.",0,Thank you for your hospitality.,4

Everyone will be talking about Taylor and... ... and maybe that's what we both need.",0,I need to come to grips with his death first. And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow.,5
1666,"You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that. What makes you say that? I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing! That's just the problem. In these kind of things, the trouble doesn't always appear at first. But everything has been so easy.",0,"Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork. Just like we planned! That may be true, but if you were to do it, you would have trouble on the horizon. You always say that.",0
1667,"this party rocks! you said it. Good beer, good music, and on top of that, there are so many hot girls here! I'm with you on that. Check out that one over there. I think I'm in love! well, she's alright, but not really my cup of tea. What about the blond with the red dress?",0,"oh, that's Janice. She's just new in town. You have a thing for blonds, eh?",0
1668,"yeah! She could do anything she wants to me! I bet. Why not go over and talk to her? She's really nice. I don't think so. I get so nervous talking to girls. I always put my foot in my mouth, scare her off, and end up looking like a real fool. Besides, she is way out of my league. come on! Man up! You'll never know until you try.",0,"okay okay, just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game.",0
1669,"all right. But I think you ought to move soon. why? I can see five other guys eying her up. okay, here I go!",4,good luck!,4
1670,I am certain I am going to fail my English test. Why are you so pessimistic? Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week. Only for this reason?,0,"Yes, I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad.",0
1671,Hello! So you are leaving today. Hello. Thank you for seeing me off. You actually don't need to bother. It is my pleasure to see you off. Thanks a lot. I hope to see you again.,4,"I hope so, too.",4
1672,"Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley, he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts. It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office. I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it. He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast. I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California. It comes from the information technology industry.. there isn't such a large division between home and office, so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in. Maybe so, but it seems kind of strange, which the rest of us in white shirts, dark suites, and ties. It's not as bad as that... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers. Besides, didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning?",0,What's that?,0
1673,"I heard you received a prize for you book. yes, I did. I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards. congratulations!

We’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match. The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and... a very nice set by Chen! Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in!",0,"It’ s China’ s service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.",0

1682,"London is such a historical city! There’ s history everywhere you look. There’ s nelson’ s column, built as a monument to one of the Britain’ s great admirals and his important victory. He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805. I’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey, where many historical figures are buried, like Isaac Newton, the great mathematician and Winston Churchill, the great wartime leader. Nearby, on the banks of the thames, there’ s the statue of Boadicea. She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain. Women have often played an important role in British history. Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588. more recently, Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980’ s.",4,She was a very controversial leader. Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later?,4
1683,"There’ s a lot to see there. Perhaps we should go tomorrow. I’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison. Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past. I really want to see the crown jewels too. I’ Ve seen them before. They’ re quite incredible. If you want to see historical figures in London, there’ s one place you have to go. Where’ s that? Oh, I know! Madame Tussaud’ s the waxworks museum.",4,"There you can see british leaders, entertainers, criminals, and royalty.",4
1684,"so, how should we go to the theatre? let's take the bus. I hate the bus system in London! The bus drivers are rude, the buses are never on time, and there are few people around who can help you. it's not that bad. You probably just had a bad experience once.",0,"it wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.",0
1685,"we could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice. train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too. if we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show. Should we take the bus? we're already late, so I think we had better take a taxi.",0,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.,0
1686,"fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives. it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes. don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you. thanks, that was nice of you.",4,"see, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!",4

1688,"Let me look at the calendar. Good! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday. Is he coming alone? No, he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls. Mother, I don't remember the girls. How old are they? Your cousin Fay is fifteen. Rosemary is older than Fay. She's seventeen.",0,Are they going to stay here with us?,0
1689,"What's your little caper? Come home so late! We are all worried about you. Oh, I am terribly sorry. But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit. So I forgot the time. Singing? At the subway exit? Oh, it sounds like someone needs some money. Oh, no, the guy was a musician who just sang. He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs. Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor. He sang for appreciation, but not for money.",0,"It is just pop song, you could have sung there too if you want it.",0
1690,"Oh, no, it was a kind of pop art. I like it but I couldn't do it that well. Honey, just do it next time. Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia? No, but tell me some. I am interested. Many oil painting exhibitions are there. That is a kind of Museum Exhibition.",0,Are there many people there? Do you think people actually like them?,0
1691,"I am sure you will. There are some works, and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors. And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train. But I still prefer the pop music in the subway. Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts, but with different aesthetic values. Dad, you talk well, but can you appreciate that kind of art?",0,"Not well enough, but I'm learning.",0
1692,It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week. Indeed. I love the smell of the grass and trees. They certainly refresh my mind. Can we stop here for a while? My backpack is very heavy. Sure. Did you hear anything? Look! An eagle is hovering in the sky.,4,Let me see. It's not an eagle. I think it's a vulture.,4
1693,"Yes. Will it hurt us? I don't think so. Let's walk by the stream. I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map. OK. I have a good pair of hiking boots. It should not be a big problem.

Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now?,4
1698,"Definitely. I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables, which is more expensive, but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them. You've really turned into a health nut, haven't you? I guess you could say that. Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy. I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great! How do you get enough protein in your diet?",0,"Well, I eat a lot more tofu, beans, nuts and some fish.",0
1699,"Well, don't worry about dinner. I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you. Do you like sushi? I prefer cooked fish to raw fish, but if you really like it, make it. How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry? That sounds great. What time should I come over?",4,"Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm, so you can come over at 7 p. m.",0

1701,"He can spend more time with his grandchildren. Oh, I don’ t think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world. So, he wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea! How do you want to spend your old age?",0,"In the same way, probably.",0
1702,Is this seat taken? No. Please sit down. Thanks. Are you also going to Beijing?,0,"Yes, on a business trip. How about Yuu?",0
1703,"I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there. Have you ever been there before? Yes, I Went there once last summer. Really? What did you think? I think it is amazing. You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway.",4,Was it that crowded?,0
1704,"Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games? Of course. It's the tradition game in winter, and with good reason. Don't you like watching it? Of course I do. I love it. All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable. That's true. For various reasons, it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics. You know, the low temperature may cause many problems.",0,Yeah. What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics?,0
1705,"When the Olympic Games started in modern times, only summer events were included. When it grew popular, there came the Winter Olympic Games, which includes a variety of winter sports. I see. Then, what's your favorite winter sport? Figure skating. In my eye, nothing beats it. Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo.",0,"Oh, I didn't expect you to know them. But yes, I love them not only because of many medals they've won, but also because of their spirits.",0
1706,"You should go to talk with May. She is a big fan of them too. Sure. What about you? What do you like about the Olympics? For me, the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart. It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible. Hey, young man, you are so deep today.",4,I always am. You just didn't notice.,4
1707,"Does she make any sense to you? No. It's all Greek to me. She's speaking French, not Greek. I know that. I mean I couldn't understand her at all.",0,Me neither. All I have to do is study French hard.,0
1708,"How are you going all these days? Fine, thanks. But you look depressed. I have some problem with my work.",0,Is it serious?,0
1709,"So what do you feel like doing this evening? How about going to the cinema? Ah, that's a good idea. But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free. Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema. That's good! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening. Would you like to go with me tomorrow night? I'd like to, but I'm afraid I can't.",0,"Why? Do you have to prepare for your examination? Oh, come on, girl, relaxation is also very important.",0
1710,"That's not the reason. I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening. You know, I've been going there every week. Oh, God, I've forgotten it. You said you wanted to improve your English, so how about coming with me tomorrow? I can also introduce some friends to you. Oh, no, I don't want to know any more geeks like you.",0,"They are not geeks. They are also interested in singing, dancing, and so on. They are excellent, and they can always help me a lot.",0
1711,"Really? Is there a foreign teacher for every class? It depends. If they are not busy, they will come to join us, and talk with us. So you just talk all the time? Of course not. The foreign teachers also teach us English songs, and play games with us.",0,That sounds interesting. I'll go with you tomorrow evening.,4
1712,"You’ re going to set up your own law office, aren’ t you? Yes. After so many years of hard work, I’ d rather I had an office of my own. If you need help, don’ t hesitate to ask me. I’ ll be very glad if you would help.",0,I’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture.,0
1713,"Wow, is that your sports car? Yes, do you like it? I love it! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar. Is it in good condition? Yt looks good on the outside, but the inside is a different story. It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again.",0,What's wrong with it?,0
1714,"Well, first of all, it needs a new engine, which is extremely expensive. When's the last time you had it serviced? It must have been a few years ago now. I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis.",0,"They do. Once my son was born, there was no reason to drive this car anymore. It's only a two-seater, you know!",0
1715,"What else is wrong with it? The heating controls don't work anymore, so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer! Anything else? The brakes don't really work that well anymore either.",0,Why don't you get it all fixed?,0
1716,"Can you play baseball with me today? No, I can't. I'm sorry. I have to help my mother. We're going to move tomorrow. Where's the new house? Is it far from here? No, it's not far. It's near our old house.",0,Can I help you pack?,0

1721,"Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world? What do you mean? I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the black market. Don't tell me you actually believe all that? Don't be so gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you.",0,"Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?",0
1722,Wow! I can’ t believe I’ m standing here! What are you so excited about? I’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art! What’ s the big deal? It’ s just a picture of some woman.,0,"I’ Ve seen it so many times in books, but I never imagined I’ d get to see it in person.",4

1729,"OK. Steven, you're looking at a picture. Please describe what you see! Uh, I can see a red double decker bus. It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London. In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names, Chelsea, Sloan Square, Victoria, Herring Cross. These are all areas in London. Um, so obviously the bus is in London. OK.

When I was younger, you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities.",0,"Oh, really. Mm! How much is the fare?",0
1730,"Well, it depends on the journey. It's.. I guess it's not too expensive, but the minimum price you would pay is, for a short journey, is about a pound. Mm, yeah, who can you see on the bus? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting? Hmm, yeah, well this girl here at the back, that's leaning on the door, um, she looks really bored, actually. Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go! Is that how you feel on the bus?",0,"Uh, well, no, not really, because I haven't worked in England for a long time, so I haven't taken a bus for a long time.",0
1731,"Bob, you look pale. What happened? I didn't sleep a wink last night. Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned! Maybe I can help you. Well, I'm under a lot of pressure. My boss is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them.",0,Is there anything I can do for you?,0
1732,"I think Bill Clinton is a good president. But he has the sex scandal. Well. Maybe he isn't a good husband, but he is a successful president. I agree. He is also an excellent speaker.",0,"Yes, he is. Of course he makes mistakes, but who doesn’ t.",0
1733,Would you like to stretch your legs? Why not? Let's get a soft drink. Do we have enough time?,4,"Yes, we do.",4
1734,The performance is excellent. It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great. I couldn't agree more. Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?,0,"Yes, it is.",0
1735,"Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine. What a lovely summer day! Yeah, clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me. I don't like heat and humidity. It's not that hot. It's cooler than yesterday. Let's go swimming! That's a thought. It's still early, and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day. If we don't stay too long, we won't get sunburned.",0,"Yeah, sounds like fun. I can wear my new pink bikini.",4
1736,"There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are. Who cares! Well, the smart guys get there early. That's the kind of guy I want to meet. Let's go! If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini, then I want to wear one, too. Ok, you could borrow one of mine.",0,"Thanks, how about the green and black one?",0
1737,"It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Yes, isn't it. Do you now the temperature today? It's beautiful 75 degrees.",0,How nice. I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week. I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend.,0
1738,"are you ready to go the concert? yes. Should we go there by bus so we aren't late? actually, why don't we go there by bike? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour. that's true. Cycling is good for our environment, too. Let me just get my helmet then.",0,is your helmet comfortable?,0
1739,"not really, but I liked the design, so I got it. maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better. I'll think about it. is that your new bicycle?",0,"yes, my father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it?",0
1740,"it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive! nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky. I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it? well, my saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height?",0,that's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle.,0
1741,"Next please! Hello sir, may I see your passport please? Yes, here you go. Will you be checking any bags today. Yes, I’ d like to check three pieces.",0,"I’ m sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, at twenty kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.",0
1742,"What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That’ s absurd! I am sorry, sir, there’ s nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big. Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this. Let’ s see... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.",0,That’ s more than my round-trip ticket!,6
1743,"How are you? Fine. I haven’ t seen you for several days. Oh, I have been with my uncle for a week.",0,What’ s he doing?,0
1744,"Dick, I’ Ve decided not to rent that house. But yesterday you said you would rent it. I’ Ve changed my mind. Why is that?",0,"Well, I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work.",0

1749,"I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad. I wonder how you managed to achieve such success? Oh, through a lot of hard work, of course.

1750,"Right. I only knew a few English sentences. That's incredible. Could you tell me what you did to make a start? First, I worked as a servant. Really? I wish you could tell me more about your experience.",6,"I'd like to, but I must run to a meeting.",0
1751,"What's the news on our website? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint? We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology, and it's surprising to see the results. What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website? From the numbers, it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines, but from our circular insert. That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format. Based on these findings, I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future!",0,You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?,0

1755,"I told you to wear running shoes. But you don't listen. I thought leather shoes will do just as well. Hold on, don't move, I will take care of that. What are you going to do?",0,"I will get some ice, and put it on your ankle.How does that feel?",0
1756,"So Chris, I've heard that you're from a big family. How many people? Nine total. Seven children and my parents. Seven children? That's a lot. Why did your parents have so many? Well, my mother came from a big family, and wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.",0,"Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.",0
1757,"It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make. Like what? I assume that there's no privacy. That's one. Another is the lack of personal property. Everything you have, from toys to clothes, is used by your brothers and sisters. Especially clothes. Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs. And the age gap is also annoying. There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.",0,Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.,0

1762,"I am kind of nervous. Nervous? Why? I don't know. I never went to a church before. I was not raised as a Christian, so I don't know what to do. Don't worry. You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen. You will enjoy it.",0,"Maybe. I know I agreed to go with you, but now I don't feel right about it.",0

1764,"I don't know the words. There is a songbook. All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words. And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine?

What is that?,0

1767,"What are you reading? It’ s an article about language. It talks about the idea of having a single global language. It seems that English already is the main global language. Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language. Actually, it suggest English. The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and japan. So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful. The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language. Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English.",0,Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?,0
1768,"Ahh... What a fine day! I do feel like an outdoor exercise. How about taking a walk in the park? OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh.

1771,"It's raining outside, Catherine, it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown? It's very hot, the temperature is often over 40 ° C. Do you like the weather in Seattle? Not really.But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.",0,Why?,0
1772,"The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day. What about the weather in Boston? I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter. Is it very cold in winter?",0,"Yes, it is.But it's nice in spring and fall.",0
1773,"Wei, you look really tired. Yes, I didn’ t finish work until 9:00 pm. 9:00! Yes, I have too much work to do at the moment.",0,Why’ s that?,0
1774,"I've heard you're going to America tomorrow. I want to see you off at the airport. Oh, thanks a lot. What time are you leaving? 1:30 P. m. But I've got to check in at 12:30 P. m.",0,What airline and what flight?,0

1781,"That girl looks very attractive, doesn’ t she? Do you think so? I don’ t like girls who look like that. I like girls who aren’ t too slim. If you like her, go and talk to her. I’ d like to, but there’ s her boyfriend. He’ s very broad-shouldered. He’ s huge! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that.",0,Do you prefer tall girls or short ones?,0
1782,"I don’ t mind, but I like girls with long hair. We have different tastes. I like girls with short hair. I like tall girls - probably because I’ m so tall myself. Have you ever dated a girl taller than you? No, never. I don’ t think I’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me! Have you gained weight recently?",0,"Yes, I have. Perhaps I should go to the gym, like that girl’ s boyfriend.",0

1792,"May, is the university a terrible place? Surely not. Life in the university is fun. Why did you ask? Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam. So I figure you would study even harder after you’ Ve got in. Studying in the university is not easy, but it's not as arduous as you think.",0,How do you know that? You haven't got in yet.,0
1793,"Of course I know. I once attended Lisa's class, sitting quietly at the back of the classroom. Oh, really? Were you not caught? Of course not. You are allowed to attend any lecture, only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class. In universities, you study in a free and creative environment. What do you want to study in the university? Have you thought about it?",0,"This question has really been bothering me. I like Chinese literature, you know. But economics is really hot now, and it has a very good career prospect.",0
1794,"Who is your favorite NBA star? Kobe Bryant, of course. Kobe? I know him, the key guy of the Lakers, a heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense. He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.",0,Maybe he is not good at rebounding?,0
1795,"Indeed, no man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit. Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA? Who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him. Well then, what are your spoils?",0,"Well, nothing more than a jumble of photographs.",0

1802,"Sorry, I overslept. My alarm clock didn't go off this morning. Again? That's right, even though I did set the alarm last night. Your clock never works. Perhaps you should buy a new one.",0,"Well. If it breaks down again tomorrow, I'll definitely buy a new one.",0

1806,"Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine? Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy? I want to buy that candy. OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready?",0,"Yeah, so far, so good.",0
1807,"Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth. Yeah, I already knew that. I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it.

1808,"What was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail? My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate.

Well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive.",0,Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?,0
1809,"I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn’ t afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood. Did your husband's family get to meet your family? My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, so that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family. That makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon?",4,We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa.,4
1810,"Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family. Why would that be funny? Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to. Why?",0,We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.,0
1811,"I don’ t agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year’ s resolution yourself. What’ s the point? We always make a new year’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It’ s pointless. Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives. What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.",0,"Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!",0
1812,"How did your vacation go? I traveled the Three Gorges. What about the trip? Do you enjoy yourself? Yes, we had a good time. The trip was terrific. We toured the Three Gorges by boat. Its realty exciting!",0,Did your boat float down the river?,0
1813,Hello! How are you. Not too well! I’ m just to the doctor. I haven’ t been feeling too well over the last few days. What have you got? A cough? A cold? That’ s the funny thing. I don’ t what’ s wrong with me. I just feel exhausted.,0,Perhaps you’ Ve been working too hard. You do have a high-pressure job.,0

1821,"Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling? I used to be an atheist. But in recent months, I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope. That sounds interesting. Have you been involved in any mystery? Not exactly, except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate. I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail. It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life.",4,What did it say about you then?,0
1822,"It's nice and bright today, isn't it? Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here. How about winter? That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp, and the road is often icy.",0,"It's boring, right?",0
1823,Sure. Do you get much rain during the summer? Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area. So you should bring an umbrella often.,0,That's right.,0

How could I do such a thing?,5
1918,"Where's Bill? The ambassador is already here. The meeting is set to start at 9 am. He's late again. Traffic is probably holding him up. You know, he commutes from the suburbs. It's not easy commuting every day. We should cut him some slack. Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there, I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late. He takes the train, remember? Oh, that's right. Well, the train shouldn't be late. That means there is only one explanation... Bill must have overslept.",0,"Well, to be fare, since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, no telling what time he actually gets up.",0
1919,"What can I do? Take the books out of the bookcase. Put them in this box. Well, the books are in the box. What can I do now? Take the magazines out of the bookcase. Put them in that box.",0,All right.,0
1920,Have we sold out all the newspapers for today? Yes. What a good job we have done! Why are so many extra gifts left here? Many customers didn't want them.,0,How about giving them to that old man?,0
1921,"Good idea. By the way, do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers? I'm not sure, but still it did attract a large crowds today. I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper.",0,But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around.,0
1922,What's your number? I'm number seven. What about you? Five. Hah hah! You have to go before me.,0,You think it's funny. I'm terrified.,3
1923,"Don't worry. It's safe. But I've never jumped off anything in my life. The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed. I'm scared. You are the one who wanted to come here, Sandy. You should enjoy it. I guess I'm adventuresome, but then I'm scared too.",3,I'm not too scared. But I've done sky diving before.,0
1924,"Wow, the view from the peak is so grand! Look, most of the maple leaves have turned red. Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene? Of course, my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child.",0,But my father did not. He didn't have much time.,0
1925,"Honey, I'm sorry. I promise you, this summer vacation, I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains. It is more beautiful and magnificent. Really? It's a deal. Have you ever been there? Yes, I went there five years ago. You were still a baby at that time. It really gets me interested. Is it higher than Kiang Shan?",0,Surely. You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls. The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty.,0
1926,"For our lunch meeting with the investors, do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up? Usually for lunch, we don't have to reserve a table, they should allow walk-ins. But to be on the safe side, I'll order a table for half-past twelve. Will that suit your schedule? I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve. Can you make the reservation a little earlier? If we start earlier, it will give us more time for a longer lunch. Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal?",0,"Yes, we'll start with appetizers, follow with a soup and salad course, then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken, and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort.",0
1927,"Hi Jane, can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening? Certainly, where will you be coming from? I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there. Ok. Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington. Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit.",4,Got that.,4
1928,"Ok - when you leave the Underground, cross the road and you should see Horntown Street. Was up that street to the crossroads. As you was you should see a fast food place on your right. Hold on, I am looking at the map now. Ok, I can see Horntown Road. Do I go straight at the intersection? No, you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right. Ok, I can see that road.",4,That's fine. You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library.,4
1929,Guess what came in the mail today? What? My acceptance letter to Yale! Wow! Congratulation! When do classes start?,4,"Freshman orientation is the last week of august, but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in.",4
1930,"You’ re so lucky! Do you have to do many things before you leave? Yes. I’ ll be very busy! I have to get a visa, buy a plane ticket, and pack my things. But first, I want to register for classes. When can you do that? Well, they sent me their prospectus, so I can start looking now. do you want to help me decide which classed to take?",0,Sure. What can you choose from?,0
1931,"Well, I have to take all the fundamental course, plus a few from my major. What is your major? I hope to major in English literature, but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year, so we’ ll see. What are the fundamental course?",0,"In order to graduate, every student must take a certain amount of classes in history, math, English, philosophy, science and art.",0
1932,"Interesting. That’ s very different from the Chinese education system. Yes, it is. It’ s also very different from the British education system. Really? oh, sure. In British, students don’ t have to take the foundation course.",0,why not?,0
1933,"Hey John, nice skates. Are they new? Yeah, I just got them. I started playing ice hockey in a community league. So, I finally got myself new skates. What position do you play? I’ m a defender. It’ s a lot of fun. You don’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense.",0,"Yeah, you’ re a pretty big guy. I play goalie, myself.",4
1934,"Do you offer a course in business management? Yes, we do. How many nights a week is it? It's 3 nights a week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.",0,And how long does the course last?,0
1935,It lasts for 9 months. When does it start? The next beginning class starts on October 25th. What time is the class?,0,From 7 to 9 o'clock.,0

1937,"Excuse me. Is there any body here? Yes. I've finished up all my water. I would kill for a sip of water. Sure, come on in.",0,Thank you very much. Are you here alone?,4
1938,My father and sister are out to photographing. What about you? I'm a back-packer from America. What is a back-packer? It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world.,0,Cool. You must have been to a lot of places.,4
1939,"Hello! Oh, hi! Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom. Pleased to meet you. My name is Alice. Did you just move in next door?",0,"Yes, I did. Have you lived here long?",0
1940,"Me? I guess so. I've lived here for about six years now. Have you lived in America very long? No, not really. When I left Vietnam, I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years. Where do you work, Alice? I teach mathematics at a college. What do you do? I am an accountant at a company",0,"Well, Tom. It's good to meet you. I have to go now. I am teaching a class this evening, and I need to get to the college.",0
1941,"You like movies? Yeah, I think it's the best way to relax. What type do you like the best? Really it depends on my mood. When I am sad or depressed, I like comedies. If I'm feeling good, I'll watch almost anything.",0,I see. I generally like movies to help calm me down. I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it.,0
1942,"I can’ t wait to retire. And then what? And then I’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day, every day! That sounds boring to me.",0,What do you plan on doing after you retire?,0
1943,"What colour is her hair? Oh, blonde, she's very blonde... quite short hair... What, curly? No, not at all. Very straight. Her hair comes down like this... just over the ears.",0,Does she wear glasses?,0
1944,"Charles, do you have any children? Yes. How many children do you have? I have two kids. A boy and a girl.",0,What are their names?,0
1945,Jack and Stephanie. How old are they? Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24. Are they in school?,0,Stephanie is. She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida.,0
1946,"I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher. Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked? I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right. These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all right?",0,That would be great!,0
1947,"Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading? This one right here should be right. Yeah, I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that, right? Yeah, let's do the math.",0,"I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does this look right to you?",0

1949,Guess what! I know something you don't know! What's that? How many planets are there in the solar system? That's easy. Everyone knows that there are nine.,0,Not anymore! Can you believe it? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore!,6
1950,"Nice try. I wasn't born yesterday, you know. I'm dead serious. They've decided that it's too small to be a planet, but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore. That sounds crazy. But they can't just change their mind about things like that. Yes, they can. If you remember correctly, people used to believe that the world was flat.",4,"I suppose you're right. They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them, not the other way around.",0
1951,We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos. Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation? I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way. Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space?,0,I hope not. I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth.,4
1952,"You're just left school, haven't you, Emily? Yes, I finished last Friday. You sound relieved. Well, yes. I don't mind admitting that I am.

1953,"Hello, Jack here. Hello, Jack. It's Mary. What are you doing in your office? I am working. I often work late on Thursdays. I am busy this week.

1954,"What about Saturday? Sorry, I never go out on Saturday evening. I always watch football on Saturday evening. Will you come round next Tuesday? Next Tuesday? Just a moment!

1957,How often do you have English lessons? I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day. How do you practice? I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week.,0,Do you ever speak to native speakers of English?,0
1958,What happened to that girl you were seeing? Oh Jackie? We broke up last week. That was a short relationship. You only started dating 2 months ago. It was actually a long two months. She was a psycho.,0,What do you mean?,0
1959,"She would be laughing one moment, and if I said something insensitive, she would start crying. I didn't want to deal with that. She sounds very emotional. She was a psycho, man. One time we were suppose to get together. I was waiting for her call, and when she finally called, she was screaming why I wasn't at her place. Were you suppose to be there?",0,I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping. It was a misunderstanding. She was literally screaming on the phone over this.,0
1960,"Adam. I’ m sorry. Where have you been, Alice, you're over an hour late. Yes, But I couldn’ t help it. I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus. The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam. It was one thing after another. why ere you getting off work so late? The office close at six, doesn’ t it?",1,Yes. But those are the rush in that moment. And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters.,0
1961,How was the movie last night? I didn't really like it. Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography. I found it very disappointing.,2,"She liked the acting, too, because that's what she wanted to see.",0
1962,Would you like to come to our party? I'd like to. But I'm not myself today. What happened? You look so pale. It's the end of the world for me.,5,What makes you say that?,0
1963,"Today, I'm told I failed three courses. Oh, that's too bad. Work harder next term. B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me. Don't lose heart. Everything will be fine.",0,I hope so.,0
1964,"hey, the new SOHO. How's everything going? everything's great. I've just returned from my office. your office? Aren't you a freelancer? sure I am. I work for myself, but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area.",0,a virtual office?,0
1965,"yeah, an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies. I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building. what kind of services do they offer? a separated office, internet access, phone services, fax services, mail & courier services, and almost everything you have in a conventional office. sounds fun.what else?",0,"I get a business address at an expensive location, and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor.",0
1966,I just love your hair that way. Thanks. Where did you have it done? My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?,4,Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.,4
1967,"That was a great party. Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up. It certainly was a great party. It’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here. I expected that something might get broken. That doesn’ t bother me. That spilled drink won’ t leave a stain, will it? I doubt it, I'll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn’ t a glass of red wine, I’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth.",0,I’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag.,0
1968,"Afterwards, we can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks. Yes, he’ s very good.. isn’ t he? He told some funny stories too. Amanda told some very funny jokes. At the beginning of the party, she was being very serious. I think that she had a litter too much of the punch.",0,"What did you put in that punch? It tasted great, but was quite strong.",0
1969,"Mom, this is your third bowl of rice! I know but I have no choice. My stomach just keeps crying for more and more. Why? I never saw you eat so much before. I've been going to the gym these days. The exercise makes me hungry all the time.",0,So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out.,0
1970,Don't pull my leg. This way you'll probably put on more weight. Will you give up? Surely not. I can feel the results. I'm starting to feel different now. Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight?,0,I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed.,0
1971,"Oh, I've got an idea. Why don't you ask Dad to go with you? He badly needs some exercise. Your father is a bit too timid. He even doesn't know how to introduce himself. He can just say, I'm Benjamin. I'm new and shy. Girl, don't make fun of your Daddy. But I can introduce him to my personal trainer. Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato.",0,Who knows!,0
1972,"Look, Bob. This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia. Let me see it, can I? This is a good photograph. Who are these people? They’ re people I met during the trip. That’ s the ship we traveled on. What a beautiful ship! Who’ s this?",0,That’ s the man I told you about. Remember?,0
1973,Ah yes. The one who offered you a job in Australia. That’ s right. Who’ s this? Guess!,0,"It’ s not you, is it?",0
1974,"Hey, Jack! Is Jenny coming with us? Yes. Why? Nothing. I am just asking. Just asking?! Why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, someone has a crush on Jenny, doesn't he?",0,Who has a crush?,0
1975,"Come on, Ted! Don't be such a chicken. If you like her, you’ Ve got to tell her. Maybe she likes you. Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out. What are you so afraid of? Just tell her what you are feeling about her. I’ d totally die if she turned me down.",0,"But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You’ Ve got to let her know. Come on! You’ Ve got to take a chance. Even though you are rejected, it’ s not the end of the world. There’ s nothing to lose, is there?",0
1976,"Shall I punch out for you, Ross? I am leaving now. No, thanks. I have got to work overtime. But today is Friday. You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening, are you? Well, I am. I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting. Is Tom coming to pick you up?",0,No. We’ ll meet at my house. He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa.,0
1977,"That's nice. Where is his villa? It's not his villa, but his father's. I think it's somewhere in Florida. I am not sure myself. Sometimes I envy you a lot. Tom is a good guy. Come on. You just haven’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much. You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life.",0,"I know, but I am a work maniac.",0
1978,"Well, suit yourself. I've got to run now. Have a nice weekend. You too. Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing. A girl called this afternoon. She said she was your ex-girlfriend. She wanted you to call her back. Did she mention anything else?",0,"No, nothing else. See you Monday.",0
1979,Are we going to have gym class tomorrow? Are you crazy? Tomorrow's Saturday. Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays. Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays.,0,So there are only five working days in a week?,0
1980,"Jacob, are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine? That depends. What does she look like? Well, she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair. How tall is she?",0,"She's fairly tall, maybe 2 inches taller than me.",0
1981,"Is she chubby? Not at all. She's actually very athletic. It sounds like she's pretty good-looking. Does she wear glasses? No, but she does wear contact lenses.",0,How's her skin?,0
1982,"She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose. Does she have any piercings or tattoos? I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos, one on her lower back, one on her neck, and one on her left foot. What's the tattoo on her foot like?",0,It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one.,0
1983,"Even her mother? Yes, even her mother. What's her personality like? She's a lot like me.",0,So there is something wrong with her! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true!,0
1984,"Good morning, Jason. How did you sleep? Pretty well, thanks. Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit, but last night I got at lease six hours of rest. Great! So, are you ready for a full day of shopping? Yep. Let's do it. I'm pretty excited!",0,I know a place that should be perfect. It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety. You can even buy a live chicken there if you want.,0
1985,"Live chicken? Thanks, but no thanks. So... tell me about bargaining. How can I do it like a local? Well. I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person. You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that. But... if you're smart, you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price. Cool! Teach me! For starters, you want to do a lot of scouting first. You've got to know what things cost.",0,"Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs. The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items, you can figure out the relative prices of everything else.",0
1986,"I’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn’ t broken! I feel just awful about this whole thing. I wanna make it up to you. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. My treat. That sounds great! I’ d love to! Here is my address. Pick me up at eight? Perfect! Thank you for such a lovely evening! The food was amazing, and I had a great time.",4,Me too.You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end.There’ s something I have to tell you...,4
1987,"Hey, you’ re early! Where’ s everyone? Well... I told them not to come. I made a reservation just for the two of us. I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves. Oh... why? Jennifer, there’ s something I wanna ask you.",0,Sure. What is it?,0
1988,"How do you usually spend your time, now that you’ Ve retired? Well, I nearly always get up at dawn. I don’ t like sleeping in late. The days are longer in summer than in winter, so I get up in summer. I usually do some exercise when I get up. What do you have for breakfast? I usually have cereal, but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast.",0,that sounds nice. How do you spend your mornings?,4
1989,"Hey. Steven. You have a large chunk of money, but why do you still live in the old flat, instead of buying a new villa? I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company. And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it. But I found you always hate to part with your money. Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker! Oh, the car is old but still in good condition. I just think we should be thrifty, whether you are rich or not.",0,But... But...,0
1990,"Judy, have you ever made out how much money shall we spend? Oh, yeah. The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB, according to our itinerary. What? That's too much. Sit down. I'll show you the list of our financial budget. First of all, it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation.",0,"Ah, the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget.",0
1991,"Julia, what do you think of the network? Network is omnipresent nowadays. It's quite convenient for people. You see, we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it, too. And the most of all, we can compose, send, and receive e-mails. Yeah, you are right. Internet makes our lives easier. But it's a two-blade sword. What do you mean?",0,"I mean Internet brings benefit a lot, but also some disadvantages. For example, many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online, etc.",0
1992,Where are you going? I'll accompany my wife to the hospital. What's wrong with her. She is expecting.,4,Congratulations to you.,4
1993,"Hi, I’ m Susan.What’ s your name, please? My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you, Susan. Where do you come from? I come from China.Are you American?",0,"Yeah, that’ s right.SO what are you studying?",0
1994,Have you figured out where you want to transfer to? I can’ t think of where to go. Where would you like to go to school? I really don’ t know.,0,You can’ t think of anything?,0
1995,"I really like where I’ m at now. So, why don’ t you just stay here? That may be what I’ m going to do. It’ s a perfectly good school.",0,You’ re absolutely right.,0
1996,"I can’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City. Oh, you didn’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable, even if they are small and crowded? Of course I had heard about that, but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here. I don’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York.",0,Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live.,0
1997,You see that chick over there? The one in the red shirt? Yeah. Isn't she hot? She's alright.,0,Just alright?!? She's hot!,4
1998,Why don't you go talk to her? You think she's out of my league? Hell no! You're just a chicken that's all. C'mon. I get nervous when I talk to girls.,0,"Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up, strike a conversation.",0
1999,What do I talk about? It doesn't matter. You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that. I don't know... Do you want me to go talk to her?,0,No. Stay away from her.,0
2000,How about a movie tonight? It doesn’ t matter to me. Does 7 o'clock suit you? Either way. I don’ t care.,0,How about a snack after work?,0
2001,I couldn’ t careless. Would you rather stay home? Whatever you say. Are you really interested in doing something?,0,I don’ t mind if you want to.,0
2002,"Thank you for showing me your offices, Mr. Becker. I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs. Why do you say that? The city is beautiful, the off..., the offices are modern and comfortable, and the work is so interesting. Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives. Government service can be a rewarding and secure career.",0,Do you mean financially rewarding?,0
2003,"Well, many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries. I’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy. Sometimes that’ s true, but not usually. Most feds are honest, hard-working professionals. It’ s hard to keep highly trained people, so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive. How much do you make?",0,"I’ m a GS - 15. That’ s high on the scale of workers, but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage.",0
2004,"Mary, how was your date with John? It’ s OK. It seems we have a lot in common. Oh, really? That is great news. What does he look like? He is tall and slim, fair-haired.",4,Sounds like he is pretty cute. What do you think of him?,4

2008,Hey Jackie. What are you doing? Nothing much. I'm just relaxing today. Why? What's going on? I was thinking about heading to the mall. Do you want to go? Are they having a sale?,0,Yeah.

2011,"It’ s so relaxing, taking a walk in the country. The air is so fresh and clean. Would you like to live in the country? I’ m not sure I’ d like it. I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage. What do you mean?",0,"Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The tow just don’ t go together.",0
2012,"I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities. People can’ t have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, buy there’ s more to do. I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They’ re so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings. I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.",0,The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There’ s so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.,4

2014,"that's too bad. I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it. Don't be too upset about it. the thing is, this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't.

2022,"Special rules? There, you only have two ways for visiting. Details? On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.",0,Why not?,0
2023,Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be. That makes sense. But that sounds interesting. Is there one in Beijing too? Yes. I prefer to go there next time.,0,"Yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.",0
2024,"What are you doing there with your mobile phone? I'm moblogging! Moblogging? what does that mean? Oh, moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging '.

You prefer abstract paintings, don’ t you?",0

2045,"How can I lose weight, doctor? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food? Well, Jim. It is a combination of how much you eat, the type of food you eat, and when you eat your meals.

Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me. What are you talking about? How does it exploit people? Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.",0,"Geez!

I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad. There is no true love between them.",0,I wouldn't say that's totally true. I've met many happy intercultural couples.,0
2074,"well, then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner? I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men. or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men. what do you mean?",0,"you know, usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl.",0

Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.",0,Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world?,0
2092,"Which country makes the best coffee in the world? Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee. Brazil exports a lot of coffee. But I love Irish coffee. So it's hard to say. Just depends on your taste. I agree. I heard in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true? Yes. No doubt about that.

2094,"The survey said that the low, income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis. That makes sense. Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper.

Anyway, she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.",0

She hung up immediately. So you asked him about the girl who called? Yeah, he first said it was someone from work. He gave me a lame excuse, and so I pressed him on it. What'd he do?",0,"He kept trying to make stupid excuses, and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.",0
2103,"Hello baseball fans, and welcome back to today’ s game! My name is Rick Fields and of course, I am here, once again, with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

One day, May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately. Really? I’ m very surprised. He doesn’ t look like a guy who’ d ever do that sort of thing, right?",6,"No, he doesn’ t. Anyway, she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time.",0
2108,Maybe it is for the best. They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people. How so? He is an extrovert while she is an introvert. He likes parties while she hates them. Poor Mary! She really liked him.,0,"Anyway, she was right to end things and she deserves better.",0
2109,"So, Karen, what do you do in your free time? Well, I like to play the piano. Really? How long have you been playing piano? About 18 years, I started learning when I was a kid.",0,"That’ s really interesting, you have to play for me some time.",4
2110,"Hi, Craig! How are you? Not so good. I have a terrible cold. Really? That's too bad! You should be at home in bed. It's really important to get a lot of rest. Yeah, you're right.",0,And have you taken anything for it?,0

2114,"I am trying to decide what school to apply to? Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? I am not sure. What's the difference between them? Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere.",0,Which is better?,0
2115,"I'm not comfortable about this, Sandy. I don't understand most of these games. That's okay. I can explain a little. I don't want to lose all my money. Don't worry. You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money.",0,I guess you're right.,0
2116,"Of course I'm right. I already told you the rule for Las Vegas. Remember? Yes, I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play. That's right. That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself. Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars. Only fifty dollars. No more.If you follow the rule, you can't lose more than fifty dollars. I know it's true, Sandy. But still some people lose control.They start to gamble, and they can't stop.",0,But I won't let you do that. I will watch you.,0

2126,I’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive. Yes. I dare say it will be. It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed. No. I don’ t think that’ s possible. Some places are sure to be open.,0,But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money.,0

I thought you really enjoyed each other's company. we did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work.",0,"can't you hang out with them, too?",0
2132,"I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out. maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you. I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her. it can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.",0,you're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.,0

2136,"Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village? I think a mountain village is splendid! I don't agree with you. It's too small to live. It has fresh air, and it is nicer than a big town.",0,"I disagree, a big town is more lively.",0

It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night. oh, really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.",0,but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.,0
2139,"definitely. you know, I often overhear our neighbor, the young couple, fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness. don't worry. I think in most cases, children are the glue that keeps a family together. I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child.",0,sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.,0
2140,"How much did you bid? Eighty-five dollars. If my bid is the highest after three more days, I win! It's fun! We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money!! But they won't! I checked the seller's history, and he got good reviews from other buyers.",0,What if he had his friends fake the reviews?,0
2141,It's taking you forever to do my hair. Give me a minute. You should've been done already. There you go.,0,I don't think that you're done.,1
2142,What's wrong? My hair looks hideous. What's so bad about it? It doesn't look good at all.,1,Sorry about that.,0
2143,"Excuse me! I don't have time to waste. I've been here almost one full hour! Sorry, madam. You have to wait your turn. The parking lot is full. Unbelievable! Parking in this city is such a nightmare! Madam, patience is a virtue.",0,"Oh, gosh! I have to go to the restroom so bad! I can't bear it anymore!",1
2144,"What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch. I'm stuck! I'm worried, Tom. I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour. I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling! I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here?",0,I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.,0
2145,"Well, now we're stuck. What can we do? I don't know. I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy. What do you mean?",0,"We're stranded here, Tom. We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.",0
2146,"I have plenty of gas. Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze. So what can we do? Turn the lights off.Then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible.",0,Alright. That's a good idea.,4
2147,"I wish we hadn't come up here. Now we'll probably be here for days. Days? Yes, it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms. People get stranded for days. Oh, my God! It's good we have food.",4,Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes. Then we'll turn it on again.,0
2148,"Mr. Bellow, have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions? I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary. But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails. Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients. That’ s good.",4,"( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr. Bellow and hands into him. ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail, Mr. Bellow.",4
2149,"Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test. Is that right? The news goes so fast. Ah, yes, I haven't decided yet. Don't hesitate. That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain. Maybe you are right. But the major is not fit for me. I like architecture more than computers.",0,But this chance is really precious.,0
2150,"Hi, Janice. Our first weekend after being employed is coming. Show me your plan. My mom phoned me this morning, and asked me to go back home to have housework chores. What are you assigned to do? God knows. Speaking of chores, I would rather do some washing than cooking.",0,"For me, I think I will iron my shirt and trousers. Actually, weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week.",0
2151,"So, did I tell you about my New Year’ s resolution? I’ Ve decided to go on a diet. And you’ re going to completely transform your eating habits, right? Exactly! I’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat. no more chips, no more soda, no more fried food. I’ Ve heard this one before.",0,"But this time I’ m going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I’ m going to be a new man in one year’ s time!",4
2152,"Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar? Which one will you be going to? We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street. Sure, I've been meaning to visit that place myself.",4,I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm.,0
2153,"OK, can I bring a date with me? Certainly. But if there are going to be four of us, I had better make reservations. Yes. that is a very good idea. It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit. Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four.",4,"I'll be there. Oh, is there a cover charge at the bar?",4
2154,Not that I know of. Why do you ask? I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I. I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine. One last question.Is there a dress code there?,0,"No, its very casual there. Leave your jacket and tie at home.",0
2155,"Give me Scotch, please. What brand? Black Rose. Soda or water?",0,Just plain water with plenty of ice rock.,0
2156,"Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet? No. what's it like? It's got its own library, theatre, swimming pool, and a guest house. The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control. It's also located near the sea, so he can park his boats next to his house. It's absolutely amazing! Would you want to live there?",0,"I think his house is fantastic, but I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, plus a few people to take care of the gardens, and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own.",0
2157,What's your dreamhole like then? My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England. Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself? Old homes are great because they've got character. I think that's important.,0,Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well? Because they've got character?,0
2158,"Rachel, do you like music? Of course. I can't live without it, so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go. What kind of music do you like best? Light music and classic music.",4,Really? I can't believe this. I am also keen on classic music. And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening?,6
2159,You look great! Thanks to you. I'm totally pumped up. So you are happy that you made the decision to join us. I surely am. But still there is one single problem.,0,What's that?,0
2160,I eat more and more these days. And it puts even more weight on me. It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning. What about trying something else? I'd love to do that. What do you recommend? More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days. Do you want to have a try?,0,Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation?,0
2161,Absolutely. But it takes great perseverance to master. I can so that. Here is a free class going on right over there. Go and join them. How did it go?,0,"Everything was okay when it started, but the music made me drowsy. So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there.",0
2162,"Do you have to leave soon? No. Actually I can stay longer. Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty. Oh, that’ s better. So you don’ t have to rush. Yeah. You know what Dave just said?",0,What?,0
2163,"He said I should put on something very nice, because this girl will be my next target. He knows you very well. He always makes fun of me. He always says things like that.

2170,"Yeah, I'm eager to learn Chinese, but it is too difficult for me. I want to study German. Can we exchange lessons? Very Good. I'd like to do that. When will we begin?",0,How about tomorrow night?,0

2174,"No, but it looks fun. I always wanted to try it. Can you take a little advice from a friend? Sure. What? Don't waste your money. Windsurfing is very hard. And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour, and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall.",0,But I always wanted to try it.,0
2175,"I don’ t know what I’ m going to do! It’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job! Don’ t worry. I don't think you’ re going to lose your job over one mistake. It was a rather big mistake. When you work as an investment adviser, one small mistake can cost the company millions. But it wasn’ t just you who was involved, right? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do.",0,"That’ s true, but my supervisor is very dishonest. There’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth. I’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault, and there’ s nothing I can do about that. My boss won’ t believe me if I tell him the truth.",0
2176,"Let’ s think realistically about what might happen. How much money do you have in your savings? I have enough to live off of for about 3 months. But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living! I’ d rather invest my money somehow. Well, you can't have everything. Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job. When is your contract up on your apartment? Next month. So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year.",0,"Well, that’ s good. If you lose your job, you can just move in with me until you find another job. That will save you plenty of money.",4

2178,"I know where the C building is. Do you mind telling me where it is? Of course, which room number is it? Number 261.",0,I actually have a class right around there.,0
2179,I'm more worried about snipers. Snipers? Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price. So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha?,0,I heard about a software program called turbid. It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction.,0
2180,"So, Fred, what are your plans for after graduation? Well, I’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown. That’ s cool. Have you already found an apartment to live in?

2181,"You mean they’ re kicking you out? Not really, they just don’ t want me living at home. My older sister did that, and she lived at home for seven years. Once she started living at home, it got harder and harder for her to move out. Well, it’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life. They said that it’ s ok if I move back home to begin with, but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so. My parents just didn’ t handle my older sister very well, and because of that, they want me to be more independent. They think that it’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own.",0,"I know I need to learn that myself, but I just don’ t have the money for it at the moment. Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place.",0
2182,"Ok, so who are we going to invite to our dinner party? Well, we have the Thompsons, the Greens, and the Anderson, about twelve people total. Don't forget my friend Andy from the office. He has nothing to do on Friday, so I invited him over. But that makes thirteen people! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!",6,Why can't we?,0
2183,"It's an old superstition. If we have thirteen people at the table, then it means bad luck. Can Andy bring a date? I'm not sure. He just broke up with his girlfriend recently, and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon. But we can't have thirteen for dinner! I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a superstition. It really doesn't mean anything.",0,Absolutely not! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday!,0
2184,"Hello, Alice. Would you like to go to the temple fair with me? Temple fair? Yes. The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth, and they have developed into a festival filled with food, performances and games now.

2189,"But I'm a new student here. I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class. I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office. Well, I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class. What is your name? My name is Karen Huang. That's spelled H - U - A - N - G. Alright. And what is your major?",0,I'm a comparative literature major.,0
2190,"Wait a minute. You're a Comp Lit major? Yes, that's right. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know you were one of our students. That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287. I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it.",0,"The university computer system saves extra places, in class 287 for comp lit students. I can give you a special code.When you register by phone, you can use the code to get into the class.",0
2191,"Even if the class is full? That's right. Oh, I didn't know that. Sure. Here is the code number, with information on how to use it.",0,Thank you. So you think I will be able to get in with this?,4
2192,"Who's that man over there talking to James? Where? Oh, that's Henry. He's very handsome, isn't he? What's he like? He's very nice, actually, but rather eccentric.",0,Really? I love eccentric people.,6
2193,"Yes, but he may be too eccentric even for you. Why? What do you mean by that? Well, haven't you heard? Heard what? No one ever tells me anything.",0,"Well, apparently, he's been having an affair with his secretary.",0
2194,"How did you first meet Jack each other? That is a heavy raining afternoon. I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain. It's getting dark. And then? I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked, ' Where is your home? '",4,Then he sent you to your home?,4
2195,"Where are you from? I'm from Germany. So you speak German, don't you? Yeah, but I can speak English, too.",0,"Oh, I see. What other languages can you speak?",0
2196,"What are you reading? Gee! You scared me! Aha, Fitness Consultant. Very good, Don't you know about the rules in this office? Yes, Ma'am. No magazines during the office hours. I'm sorry.",0,"Well, don't do this again next time. What is it about, anyway?",0
2197,"It is about sports for white-collar workers, people like you and me. What kind of sports? Aerobic sports, for example, jogging, yoga, skating... Interesting. What were you reading just now?",0,Stretching exercise after sitting a long time.,0

2201,"I'm reading an interesting report on Mars. Oh, what does it say? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars? Absolutely! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface. It's just a matter of how deep it is. Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants?",0,The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.,0
2202,"Actually, we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet? I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, but they have looked at various designs. One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory? Well, I'm not really an expert in this area, but my understanding is that anything is possible. It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago.",0,But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans.,0
2203,"When are we leaving for our field trip? Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a. m. in the morning. Can you mark that on your calendar? Yes, I will write that down. That will be Monday, December 2nd. We need to start loading the buses half an hour early, so plan to arrive at 7.",0,"Yes, I will be there on time.",0
2204,"We will return 6 days later on December 8th. Will someone be picking you up? Yes, someone is coming to get me. The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p. m. and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p. m. What should we bring with us?",0,I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. Check it out when you get a chance. See you Monday!,0

2207,"Oh, my! It's really hot. I've never seen such scorching weather in my life. Tell me about it! It's like the whole world is broiling. Oh, look at the thermometer! The temperature has hit 98. I hope it's not gonna break into three digits",0,But it's already awfully close.,0
2208,"do you want to go out for dinner tonight? sure. Have you got anywhere in mind? I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions. that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?",0,"I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.",0
2209,"if you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, they've westernized their food, so it's not actually that spicy. you're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us. the Taj? They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food.",0,the Taj it is then.,0
2210,shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money? they'll still charge us a corkage fee. that's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway. don't worry about money. I'll treat you tonight.,0,are you sure? We could go Dutch.,0
2211,"Robin, what are you going to do tomorrow? Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning. And later? Well, in the afternoon, after a long nap, we’ ll go yachting with Nora.",0,It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow.,0

2213,"The summers are so great here! Not hot at all. I love the cooling breezes, the clear air, all the greenery. This really has been a wonderful holiday for us. Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while? Let's do both! Are we in a rush or anything No, not really. I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight, but we can't unless we rush it. Let's stay in Bremen instead. Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg, then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there.",0,"Sounds fine to me. Whatever, let's enjoy this pond first.",4
2214,"Hey Jack. What's going on? Hey Matt. I'm going to ask Martha to marry me? Really? When did you decide this? I always knew she was the one, but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago. I'm just debating on how to do it.",0,"That's exciting, man.",4
2215,"So how did you propose? You shouldn't use my example. It wasn't special. I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now. What do you think I should do? There are a lot of options. You can surprise her over dinner, or ask her in a public area, or if you have the balls, ask her father in front of her.",0,I never thought about that.,0
2216,"Thought about what? Asking her father in front of her. How do you think she will react? I don't know. You should know how she's going to react. She is your girlfriend. I think that's the idea I was looking for. Thanks, man.",4,Don't mention it. Good luck. You're going to need it.,4
2217,"The bridegroom looks a bit nervous. On this occasion, most people do. Oh, they are playing the wedding March. Here they come. She is a beautiful bride.",4,I am so happy for them.,4
2218,"Are you crying? Yes, I always cry at weddings. Harris and Anne are perfect for each other. Yes, they are.",4,You and Tom also make a great couple.,4
2219,"Hi, Jack. Long time no see! Yeah. How's everything going? Not bad. At least I am still alive. Just alive? I guess you are some lucky guy. I heard you are going out with Jane.",0,Where did you get that idea?,0
2220,"Here's your drink, sir. No, that's not right. I didn't order a coffee. I ordered a cola. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'll go and get you cola right away. Waiter!",1,"Yes, sir. I'll bring your drink right away.",0
2221,Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree? I suppose I do. The climate here is pleasant. You said it.,0,This city is really comfortable to living.,4

2223,"yes. I hope it pans out. Cross your fingers, Lily. sure it will. Oh, no, it's seven fifteen already. I'm going to be late for my date. oh... so you buried the hatchet with Steven? absolutely not! He's a cheater. I will never talk to him again. I'm over with him.

2226,"hi, Meally, do you know that guy over there? The tall one? Sure, that's Drive, he works with Lily. He is cute. What dose he do? I'm not sure, he is a manager I think.",0,Really? Are you going to introduce us?,6
2227,These things are always oooo boring. Heard any gossip? Anybody making the big bucks? Rich struck it rich in advertising. And he and Cath got married and just had a child. That's no news. Those two were high school sweethearts anyway. Teresa Jones got a boob job.,0,"Uh, I can see that. And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight.",0
2228,"How are your Chinese lessons going? Oh I’ m learning very slowly. I think Chinese is more difficult than English. Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier.

2234,Let’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus. Better take the subway. It’ s faster and more convenient. Okay. It will be a new experience for me. We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway. Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy.,0,where do we pay the fare?,0
2235,Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token. Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in. Let me pay for it. Where can I get the subway Madam? Ask the worker who sells token to give you one. It’ s free of charge. Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations.,0,Do I have to pay additional fare to change train?,0
2236,"I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week. I want to see it. Is it horror movie? Yeah, I love horror movies the most. Would you like to go with me next weekend? No way. I will be scared out of my wits.",0,"Well, What kind of movies do you like?",0
2237,"Er, let me see. Romance, comedy, documentary, action, science fiction, cartoon and so on. In a word, you like all the movies except for the horror movies. Yeah, It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned. Not quite. I also like romance and comedy movies very much.",0,The Terminal is a movie of this type.,0
2238,"Excuse me, sir. Could you spare a minute? Uh, yes. Do you go to work by train every day? Yes. I commute five days a week by train.",0,And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service?,0
2239,"It’ s really very good. Why do you say that? Well, trains are frequent and come on time. Which train do you catch in the evening?",0,I usually take the 5 thirty home.,0
2240,"Hi, Kate. Hi, Don. What a surprise! Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn’ t sure. We haven’ t seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now. Have you noticed what has changed?",0,"Oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?",0
2241,"Yes. I’ m on a diet, but I’ Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I’ Ve lost twelve pounds. Wow! That’ s great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break. What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I’ m taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday. Dance? You only go dancing? That’ s not hard. I can do that.",0,Sure. Join my class next week.,0

2243,"It is very convenient. You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time. Yes, if we do business through other ways, it will cost a lot of time. Also it has low cost, and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet, which is very cheap. Yes, going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much. But does it have any disadvantages?",0,"To be frank, sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways.",0
2244,"You mean there may be credit problems? Yes, but if you choose some good B2B websites, such problems can be avoided. Will you give some suggestion? Of course, such as the Alabama, which is a famous website.",0,Thanks. Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future.,4
2245,"Alright everyone settle down. Let’ s get started.As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first? Cinct de mayo? No, that’ s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers’ Day. Do we get a day off from school then?",0,"No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.",0
2246,"Www, man! In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’ s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect. Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now? Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.",0,And then what happened?,0
2247,"Did your wife give birth yet? Yeah. She's a healthy beautiful girl. Congratulations. How is your wife doing? She is tired, but getting a lot of rest now.",4,That's good to hear.,4
2248,"I'm just glad there were no complications. If your wife and baby are both happy, what more can you ask for? It's been a week, and I haven't slept that well. That's normal for anyone with a newborn.",0,"Yeah, but it's so hard. I have to work, and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby. I'm going to get sick at this rate.",0
2249,"Irene! I heard you were on a date last night! So, how how did it go? I want all the juicy details! Um... well, actually, we had a fantastic time last night. He was... amazing! Okay, now you really have to fill me in. What’ s he like? He’ s really good looking. he’ s quite tall, around 61, he’ s in his early thirties, and he’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes...",0,He sounds hot! What does he do for a living?,0
2250,"Hi, Lucy. What are you going to do this weekend? I have no idea yet. Do you have any suggestions? Would you like to play tennis with me? I'd like to.",4,Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning.,4
2251,I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan. Do you know that? I don't know. Really? Yes.,0,But some classmates said you took the money.,0
2252,"It is not true. Look at my eyes. Well, I confess. I did it, because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill. I'm ashamed that I did that. Return the money to Jim and make an apology. I think he will forgive you.",0,I will.,5
2253,"Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem? I don’ t know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is? Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Mmmm, it doesn’ t look good. What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It’ s brand new!",1,"Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.",0
2254,"Do you like climbing? Yes, I like it very much. How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow? Where is it?",4,"It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing, in a park with the same name. There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer, so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain '.",4
2255,"Have you visited it before? Many times. Except climbing, there are many attractions worth visiting. Like what? It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November. During the period, thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area. The bright red, pink, scarlet, and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout, with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between.",4,Sounds marvelous.,4
2256,"Lester, you are really fantastic at automobile repair. Thanks, June. But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I’ m allowed to repair cars for a living. That’ s not a big problem. There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified. I guess I never thought of that before.",4,"And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school, or from the government.",4
2257,"Hey, Ted. What are you up to this Friday? Well, I have the day off from work. That’ s great! Do you have any plans? Well, I’ Ve been working so hard lately, so I’ ll probably just take it easy.",4,Sounds nice.,4

2259,"How do you like waltz? It's very nice, I like it very much. May I invite you for the first dance? My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.",4,"In fact, I took up dancing quite recently, too.",4
2260,"Oh, really? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well. I'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner. Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like the samba and waltz? Yes. And what dances do you like best?",4,Waltz is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances.,4
2261,What can I do for you today? I need to return a book. Can I do anything else for you? I want to check this magazine out.,0,We don’ t allow people to check out magazines.,0

2267,"I have a Canon SLR. so, you must be pretty interested in photography then. I'd call it one of my hobbies. Do you know much about photography? actually, I do. I took quite a few photography classes at University.",0,have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend?,0

2270,"Oh, hi Pam. When did you get back from Canada? How was it? The day before yesterday. I only visited Montreal and Ottawa, but I had a great time. Which city did you like better? That's hard to say... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing, too. A lot of museums and galleries.",0,And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it?,0
2271,"Which language do you speak? Well, I studied French at school, but I’ Ve forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa Yes, I do. I’ m learning Chinese now on the internet. How do you find studying a language on the internet?",0,"It’ s not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn’ t too good.",0
2272,"I bet you find the character difficult to write! Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they’ re easy for me. So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right? Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?",0,"In a way, it’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.",0
2273,"Professor, I will not be here for our next class meeting. Is this absolutely necessary? I tried to work something out, but I really do have to miss one class. Will you be able to make up the work you missed?",0,I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading.,0

2275,"Ms.Green, are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States, or do they differ in various sections? The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States. Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools? Most public schools in the United States are very good, and the majority of students attend the public schools.",0,"Which students go to private schools, then?",0
2276,"Children needing special instruction. Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools, and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education. But are the public schools good everywhere? No, public schools can be very different. Even in the same city. Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend?",0,"The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student. In most states, even the textbooks are free. There are no restrictions as to color, race, or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so.",0
2277,"Have you seen this? What? They killed another hostage. Oh, how awful. What a terrible thing to do.",2,I agree completely. I just don't understand what's wrong with them. Don't they have any humanity?,2
2278,"Well, maybe they've got a point. I mean, I suspect that they think the same about us. Yes, but that doesn't make them right, does it? Just because they think so? I guess not. My view is that we should give in to their demands, so that innocent people can stop getting killed. Come on, you can't be serious! We should never give in to terrorist's demands, otherwise where would we be?",0,"Well, that's probably true, but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it. A colleague of mine was kidnapped once, so perhaps I have a different view of things.",0
2279,"Where did you get your mobile? It's really cute. Oh, this? I got it in Singapore. Here, do you want to take a look? Thanks. Gee, it's really light! Yes, it is, isn't it? A bit too light, really. What make have you got?",4,I've got an old Ericsson. Here. Take a look.,0

2281,"Are your ready to go to the supermarket? Yes, are you? I've got my money and my keys, so I'm ready. You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you.",0,It wasn't cold out this morning.,0
2282,"Well, it's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there! Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you? It does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping. That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.",0,Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here.,0
2283,How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know. The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night. Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse. I don't think we have anything to worry about. Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well?,4,Good idea. That will help us to warm up.,4
2284,"Is everything ready for the Christmas party? Almost. I’ Ve put up the decorations, and we’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles. I like the big star on the top of the tree. I’ ll put the presents under the tree later, how’ s the food. I’ Ve prepared most of it already and we’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know, crisps, biscuits, and things. Are you going to make the punch?",0,Yes. I’ Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won’ t take long to make. How many people are coming to the party?,0
2285,"I think everyone will be coming. Dave don’ t come because he has to go to his parent’ s home and they live in Scotland. Do we have Christmas pudding? Yes, we do. I hope we have enough for everyone. Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time? Yes, I did. I send most of them a week ago. I’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person.",0,I did the same. I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents. I hope I didn’ t forget to buy anyone something!,0
2286,"Hey, Brad. How was your day? Pretty good. Where are you going? I'm going home. Wait. We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed.",0,Is that right?,0

2289,Hi! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection. There’ s so much I want to do. I’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world. I just ran a search for music to download. I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit. Thanks. That would be very helpful. I’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want. There’ s too much information on the net.,4,"When you sent your emails, did you attach any files to them?",0
2290,"Yes, I did. There’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments, so I’ m sure I haven’ t sent anything nasty to anyone. When you use the internet, be careful not to give out your email address very often. If you do, you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things. That’ s good advice. I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself, such as my password and credit car number. That’ s right. Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites. Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit.",0,How do I do that?,0
2291,"Is there any more vodka in that bottle? Hum, I think there's enough for one more, yes. Marvelous. Pass it over. My name's George, by the way. Nice to meet you, George. I'm Irene.",4,"So Irene, what do you do?",0
2292,"How are you feeling, champ? Ready to go? You know, if I can keep up my workouts, I think I have a chance in 2004. In what? In gymnastics. I'm pretty flexible. Look! I can even touch my toes!",0,Can you do the vault?,0
2293,"Who's that tall guy over there? Oh, that's George. He looks very drunk. What's he like normally? Oh, he's really reserved, normally. But, from what I hear, he's got lots of problems.",0,Really? What kind of problems?,6
2294,"Well, off the record, of course, but I hear that he's got terrible debts. He has his own company, and it's not going very well. Really? Well, I hate to say this, but I'm not surprised. Really? What makes you say that? Well, he doesn't look very honest.",0,"I know, that's the problem. He can't find any customers. It's a pity, really, because his products are very good. Oh, that reminds me. Did I tell you about my new laptop?",0
2295,"Oh, don't talk to me about laptops. Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything. I hate them. Oh, really? Look, I need another drink. Do you want one? Yes, I'll have another cocktail.",4,Vodka martini?,4
2296,"Hello. Is this Ann? Yes, it is. Kelly? Yes, it's me. Do you have a cold?",0,No. Worse than that. I have a flu. I'm in bed with a fever.,0
2297,"Oh, no! What about your presentation today? I'd like to do it, of course. But I just can't. I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it. I understand. What should I tell Mr. Morley? Why not just tell him I'm sick? I'll ring him myself this afternoon.",0,Alright. Have you been to see a doctor?,0
2298,"Not yet. I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway, I have a flu. I know what it is. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too? I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments. I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think. It's rainy weather today. Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep.",0,"Yes, that's what I plan to do. Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it.",0
2299,"That bad, huh? Yeah, I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever. Well, I'll cancel your appointments for today. And I'll tell Mr. Morley. Thanks, Ann. Talk to you this afternoon.",4,Hope you feel better.,4
2300,"Susan, good evening. Why are you so dressed up? I am on my way out to a New Year’ s banquet. How do I look? Is my make-up OK? You look great. Your make-up is perfect. Do you think I should wear a different dress?",4,"No, the one you have on looks fabulous, especially with your hair like that.",4
2301,"Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear? With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect. Thanks for helping out. Now that I’ m ready, what are you doing tonight? Not much, just a house party with some friends.",4,Sounds fun. Anyone I know?,4
2302,What do you like to do with your free time? Study English. You mean you like to study English? Why? It gives me great satisfaction.,0,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction. It's hard work.,0

2304,"How wonderful it is to be in love! It's love at first sight! Oh. he's my Romeo! Hey, Julie. How's it going? Oh, Mary. You've surprised me! Who were you talking to?",4,Um — I was just thinking aloud.,4
2305,"You look so happy. I see a twinkle in your eyes. Come off it, Mary. Oh, you have a crush on someone, don't you? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes! You certainly do like teasing me, Mary. Well I'm in love with someone. The question is, how do I get his attention?",4,"Well, that's easy. Walk up to him and kiss him.",4
2306,You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager? Yeah. Are you sure? Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted.,0,Just because he gets on well with everybody?,0
2307,"Would you like to come by and play bridge? Well, let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change? We haven't done that for a long time. Well, to tell the truth, I don't really feel like it tonight. I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired. Hmm.Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.",0,"Oh, we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different?",0
2308,"Well, do you have any suggestions? Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge? It's OK with me, but we don't have any beer and things. Well, shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.",4,OK.,4

I accept your advice. Hello, Tom. I'm really glad to meet you here.",4,"I'm glad too. Steven, I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife.",4

That isn't true. Actually, we have been separated for six months.",0,"I can't believe it. But if you both determine to divorce, I hope you will have an amicable split.",0
2312,"Dad, I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation. That's a good idea. You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes. Many people are learning how to drive now. I will get registered now at once. Do you know any training schools? I am not sure. You can search for them on the Internet.",0,"OK. look, I've typed driver schools, and there are so many results coming out.",0
2313,"Let me see. teetee Training School, summer program, 3,000 Yuan, learn how to drive within one month, and get driver's license within three months. 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep. I think so. Let's see the next one, 3,500 Yuan, summer program. Forget it. I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous. They offer many programs and there are many classes available. The charge is also fair.",0,"Search on the Internet then, see if we can find something more about it.",0
2314,"Did you have any hobbies? Yes, reading is my hobby. What kind of books do you like to read most? Many kinds of books.

It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival. My pleasure. Well, the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October, and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month. What do you think we can see during the festival?",0,"I don't know what to suggest. There're so many attractions, and they all sound interesting. One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town. You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations.",0
2324,"How do you know? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales. You're right. We're not really into used stuff. Well, I've grown to like second-hand things.

Let's go check out a flea market later.,3
2325,"Did you move into your new apartment? Yes, but I’ m afraid it’ s still a mess. I haven’ t put anything away yet. Don’ t worry. It’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized. Don’ t say that. It looks like a dump now. I can’ t stand it.",0,Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet?,0
2326,"Unfortunately, yes. What do you mean by that? I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station. It took me 20 minutes. Yes, but you only pay 800 dollars a month. Emm, it’ s hard to decide which is better, shorter commuting time or lower rent.",0,"I thought paying a lower rent would be better, but now I’ m not sure.",0
2327,"I want to buy a parking permit, please. Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings? I attend both day and evening classes. Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?",0,I ride a motorcycle.,0

2331,"Kitty's? He sure gets around, doesn't he? Looks like it. So how did he handle it to? His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again. I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.",0,I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.,5

2334,"Can you believe the headlines? What are you reading? I'm reading about Michael Milliken, the Bond King. Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, didn't he?",0,He got arrested all right.,0
2335,"If I remember, he got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison. Yup, that's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless. I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire. That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.",0,I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years.,0
2336,"I am not sure what to do during the holidays, any suggestions? Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices. The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun. I just don’ t know what to do first. Why not start with the most interesting one?",0,"Actually, I’ m interested in all of them. The more choices we have, the harder to make a decision.",0

2342,"What can I do for you? Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two? Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue? Yes, but I don't think they are enough for me.",0,"Oh, maybe you can find something from the New York Times, or the Washington Post during that period.",0

I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city. you don't look very happy in that picture.",0,"no, by that time, I was sick of sightseeing. I had had enough of art galleries, cathedrals, fountains, statues, and palaces!",0
2346,"so what did you do? we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market. We had a few coffees, watched a movie, and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel. my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing. Did you go to the Louvre? of course! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though.",0,that's what everyone says! I can't wait to see it for myself some day.,4

2350,"What's all the security check about, Jimmy? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place? No, of course not. Just in case. Nothing to worry about. Don't you also do this in China? I don't know. Maybe the same. Actually, this is my first time being in a bar. Oh, then it's my honor to be here with you. I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar. You like this place?",4,"Sure. I love this place, especially the decoration. So tasteful!",4
2351,"Yeah. Other than that, the real feature is the excellent drinks. Can I have your ticket? Here it is. But, what for? We're already in. Well, with the ticket, you can get a free drink. What would you like? Orange juice? Yes, orange juice will be fine for me. But how can you get the drink? It's so crowded there around the counter. You can barely move.",4,"I'll show you how.

2357,"I don’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food. I know what you mean, it leaves a lot to be desired. Sure, like taste, variety, nutritional value, what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself.

2362,"To tell you the truth, I don’ t know if I’ m a Christian or not. Christians don’ t often share the same belief. But I believe that we all possess, by the grace of God, the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth. Do you believe that one religion is better than another? No, all religions are essentially based on the same ideals, so no one is really better. Do you go to church regularly?",0,"When I’ m home in the States, I go, but not in China.",0
2363,"Hello everyone! I’ m Rick Fields, and here with me is Bob Copeland. Howdy folks, and welcome to today’ s game! You know, Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada.

Yes, when a book is on reserve, a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book.

2466,"His house must be worth millions! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford. The surrounding area is really peaceful, and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient.

No one in the family expected to get a dime from him. It was quite a surprise.",6,What a lucky man.,4

2473,"I don't care. I need money. Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime, but do you think it's really worth? Yes, I think so. When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half. Oh, yes. Money comes faster in that way than otherwise.",0,But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited. Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage.,0

I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending. Four hundred? No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she’ s going to be a professional opera singer? Ah...",0,"And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us.

Your sister’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what’ s their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we’ ll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!",0

Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes, heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver. But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content, serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system, as well as other organs, and leads to addiction I don't think so.

If I think I’ m getting into a bad mood, I call some friends and socialize or have a chat. that’ s a good idea. I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody. I hate spending too much time at home. I get bored of it really quickly. I’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people.",2,perhaps I’ m being too shy. I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests!,0

Well, it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too.",0,I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married.,0

2561,"I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends. Me too. Recently, I've made many friends on the net.

2564,I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn’ t know what to do with it. You did? Yes. But now I’ Ve learned differently. Now I have a more realistic opinion. What do you think now?,0,"There are lots of jobs, and almost everybody works. There is a high standard of living. People earn a lot, but they spend a lot to live. So there isn’ t so much money after all.",0
2565,"Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age, but young people want an unconstrained life. It would be good for both if they lived separately. My parents want to live apart from us. What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after? Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities. If it's needed, they would live with their parents.",0,"When I’ m old, I’ ll also be like that.",0

This Star Wars episode was incredible! Why do you think so?",0,"Well, one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects. State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes, so audiences have high expectations for this one, and I don't think they will be disappointed.",0
2569,"You are right. The special effects were amazing. And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes, weapons and creatures. It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie. Yeah! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes. I know exactly what you mean. Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling.",0,"I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting, but I don't think the character development was that strong.",0
2570,"Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie? No, the casting is great and the actors were excellent. They just didn’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues. The writing was also a little weak. Well, maybe. But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker. I can't imagine anyone else playing that role. I liked him too. He is so cute! You know, even though I was slightly disappointed, I can't wait for the next episode. I wonder when they’ re going to start making it and when it’ s scheduled for release?",0,"I've no idea. But looking at the success of Star Wars episode, I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon. I hope It will be even better than this one.",0

We should go out exciting. What can you see in the subway? Nothing!,0
2649,What can you see from a tram or a double-decker? I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk. I can see cars driving on the streets. I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind. I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air. But they are not as convenient as the subway. You miss the point! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere.,0,"Well, maybe you are right. We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway.",4

When we raise animals for food, the conditions they live in are often poor. Perhaps people should stop eating animals. We could grow more crops. What would you do with all the animals? You couldn’ t just let them go. Besides, some people would still hunt them. Meat has become an integral part of our diet.",0,We could provide them with better conditions anyway.

2722,"Tiffany, why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate? I think that, as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure, it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people, and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced. There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group. But how should you screen potential mates? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail? I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long.

Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world.",0,Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net?,0

2727,"Well, you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments. I missed a credit payment last month. Now my bank account's overdrawn, and the company is threatening to take back my purchases. What did you buy? A new home health monitor. Health Monitor? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with! Listen, if I were you, I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical.",6,You're kidding!,6
2728,"OK, Ann, you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that? I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney. Mm-hm. How long were you there? I was there for almost a year.",0,"Oh, OK.",0
2729,"And I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast. Up to Frasier Island. Which is a world heritage site. And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the..., which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. So, did you, did you lose your finger? Almost. Almost. Ah, you're lucky. Um, it's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks, but not clams.",0,Exactly.,0
2730,I have just had my new paper published. You have done excellent work. I'm going to Britain. Really? How did you get the chance?,6,I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD.,4
2731,Guess who I saw yesterday? I don't know. Who? Avril Lavigen! The Canadian rock singer? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday. How did you see her?,6,"Yeah, I worked as temporary staff in her concert. Look, her poster, a CD...",0
2732,"So you're a big fan, eh? Not really. But I like some of her songs. She's actually very talented. She's a song writer and fashion designer, too. And she was in a movie once again, right? Yeah, though I don't think her acting skills are that great.",0,What was your impression of her when you saw her in person?,0
2733,I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades. Grades are based on many things What counts the most? Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.,0,Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?,0
2734,"Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each. What if we miss something? I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time. Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?",0,You will be able to track your progress during the year.,0
2735,"Okay, show me your card hand. Here's mine. I have three Kings and a pair of Aces. How did you get that? No need to show you my hand, I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw. Thanks again for buying the tickets. That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen. That silver electric guitar was really cool. They're quite popular now. Wasn't her voice good?",4,"That, My Heart Will Go On. It warms my heart. you know, JanetJackson, Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different.",0
2736,"Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music. Celine just seems to hit all the right notes. Have you heard Maria Carey? Yes, l have two of her Cds, l'II lend them to you if you like. Excellent. You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD. It's her new one.",4,I hope you have a good stereo.,0
2737,Sarah. You look terrible. What's wrong? My grandmother just passed away. I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this happen? A couple of days ago. I just go back from the funeral.,5,Is there anything I can do?,0
2738,No... not really. The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died. I really wanted to be there one last time. I'm sure she knew you loved her. Did she pass away in the hospital? Yeah. She died in her sleep. I'm sorry she's gone.,0,At least she didn't suffer.,0
2739,"I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together. I know. But I miss her. When my grandmother passed away, I frequently visited her in the cemetery. I always talked to her. Even though she wasn't there, I somehow knew she heard what I said. Yeah? That's what I was thinking too. Thanks.",4,It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day. We should get you something to eat.,0
2740,"I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already! Well, have you thought of getting an MBA? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top. An MBA, hey... well my degree wasn't in business, the business schools won't be interested in me. Nonsense! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.",0,GMAT? What does that stand for and what will the test contain?,0
2741,"Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts Okay, this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this? Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well! No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat!",4,Umm... That's the spirit!,4
2742,"hello, Kate! How are you doing? fine, thanks. How are you? fine. How are your term papers? oh, my lord. I haven't really started them.",0,how could it be? They are due two weeks later.,6
2743,"This is the good life! We have it good don’ t you think? Yeah of course! Although, don’ t you ever wonder what could have been? What do you mean? Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.",0,For example?,0
2744,"Like for example, if I hadn’ t studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to. I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn’ t have gotten married if I hadn’ t moved to this town and met Sally. You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn’ t even have met if I hadn’ t been in that car accident ten years ago! Well, I have no regrets!",4,I’ ll drink to that!,4
2745,"Would you like to go to the movies tonight? Well, I just saw a horror movie last night. It almost frightened me to death. Well, we could see something different like a detective film. I don't care for a detective film. It also makes me nervous.",0,How about a comedy?,0
2746,"No, I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful. How about a love story then? No, romance is boring. What's you opinion?",0,"Let's go to see a war movie, shall we?",0
2747,Hi. Bob! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight. So why don't we take it easy this weekend? Okay! What do you suggest? How about seeing a play? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater. Is that so? Why not?,4,"( looking at a newspaper ) Oh, dear me! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend. So we have to go to cinema instead.",6
2748,"What's on? Let me see.. um. Gone With the Wind. It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night. That sounds interesting. Which is the nearest? Ah. The Royal, I think.",0,What time does it start?,0
2749,"Why don't we go to the 7:30 show? It is convenient to us, I think. But we won't have enough time for dinner. Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show? Ah... I fancy going to the later show.",0,"Then, there's a 9:30 show.",0
2750,"Are you ready, honey? Sorry, not yet! can you help me to select the dress? i don, t what i should wear to fit thinner party. Just dress formal. How about transom?",0,"It is too loud, we’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner.",0
2751,"What's the matter with you, then? You look miserable. It's us. What do you mean by us? Well, we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember?",0,"What do you mean? We're talking now, aren't we?",0
2752,"I think it is time to study. Our chemistry exam is coming. Oh, I know. When is it? December 1st. What's on the test?",0,It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten.,0
2753,Well. I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam. Why are you so pessimistic? I'm not being pessimistic. I'm being realistic. My chemistry is so bad. I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation. Don't lose your heart.,0,Thank you. That's very nice of you.,4
2754,"Are you new here? Yes, I am. Is this your first year in college? I actually transferred here from another school.",0,Which school?,0
2755,I transferred from PCC. How do you like it here compared to PCC? I love it here. Do you like it better here or at PCC?,0,"Don’ t get me wrong. I like it here, but PCC is better.",0
2756,I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night. Who was it? Kate. She said she was too excited to go to sleep. She never cares about others.,2,It’ s true. Guess what we were talking about last night.,0
2757,"if you can choose, will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese? why? Did tom pop the question? not yet. But I wonder if I can get my parents’ consent. let me guess, your parents want you to marry a Chinese man, right?",0,you are right. It is giving me a real headache. I feel like I’ m between a rock and a hard place.,0
2758,"I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex. oh, how did you deal with it? I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend. But finally we broke up. oh, it’ s a pity. What was the matter?",0,simple. We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences.,0
2759,"like what? he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family. Oh, I see. In their culture women should put family first. yes, he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family. But I simply can not quit working.",0,so that's why it’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner.,0
2760,"I don't know how to adjust my life. Would you give me a piece of advice? You look a bit pale, don't you? Yes, I can't sleep well every night. You should get plenty of sleep.",0,I drink a lot of wine.,0
2761,"If I were you, I wouldn't drink too much. I often feel so tired. You better do some exercise every morning. I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me.",0,"Why do you worry about your future? You're very young, and you'll make great contribution to the world. I hope you take my advice.",0
2762,"Hi Joe. You met my new assistant, right? Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. You are kidding, but she's so helpful. Tom... you are her boss, you kown.Of course, she's helpful to you.",0,Come on. She's like that with everyone.,0
2763,"Hey, you, pick up that piece of garbage! Huh? Me? Yeah, you. I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground. Can't you read the No Littering sign? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering, so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there. Why should I do that? It's only a piece of garbage. Why should you care?",0,"Because this is a public place, and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage.",0
2764,"How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing? I've never really thought about it before. I guess it doesn't bother me. Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping? I guess so. I usually buy name-brand clothing, shoes, and electronic goods. How about you?",0,I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!,2
2765,"I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money, I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds. I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time, but I don't think it always makes sense. Do you have a brand preference for anything? I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo, but I don't for higher-end items.",0,"What do you think about the "" impossible is nothing "" billboard on the high street?",0
2766,"Did you see the fashion awards last night? I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that. Not interested? Not really, to be honest. Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me.",0,But they are showing what will be all the rage next year.,0
2767,"All the rage with whom? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street. Did you know that fashion is cyclical? What, it keeps coming back? Precisely! For example, Flares were popular for a while, then went out of fashion. Now we can start to see them coming back in again.",0,Flares?,0
2768,"Maybe we all will be all things to all men. How terrible! But for the life, we'll be changed by this society. I really don't want to go into the world, I feel afraid of it.",0,Don't be silly. We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves.,0
2769,"You're late. I know I'm late. I'm sorry. I tried to call you to tell you, but your phone seems to be disconnected. My phone? Yes. An automatic message says your phone is not in service.",0,"Really? I had no idea. Let me check.Yes, it's dead. There's no dial tone.",6
2770,"So I couldn't get through. I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater. That's why I'm late. But this is terrible. I'm expecting important calls. About what? You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone. Oh, what can I do?",0,"Well, the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast.",0
2771,"Do you have a cell phone? No. I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone. Can you drive me? I will go to Ann's house. It isn't far. I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room. Yes, of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away?",0,"Yes, I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house, then we'll just return here.But if not, I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me.",0
2772,"Would you like to go to a concert tonight? I'd like to very much. All right, then.There is one at the new concert hall. Who's playing?",0,It's the Powell orchestra.,0
2773,"I am unsure how to add a class and need help. I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? Yes, I have an add sheet. After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?",0,"No, I'm not sure.",0
2774,"When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line. Thanks. I understand what to do now. It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet. That sounds good.",4,"Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class. Good luck!",4
2775,I found out when Jim's birthday is. It's this Friday. Let's plan a surprise party for him! Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food? That's easy. Anything else?,4,"Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available, she can come too?",0
2776,"In spring, people are feeling refreshed. They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps. They feel they are full of spirits and energy. Women in particular. They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress. Well, when summer comes, the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening. No one would like to stay in the open air for long. That's true. In summer, the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool.",0,"I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects, especially the singing of cicadas.",0
2777,"In autumn, almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested. And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity! Well, winter is a season for relaxation, do you agree with me? Well, it's hard to say. For the fields and rivers, winter is a relaxing season, but for farmers, I think they might take a rest physically, but mentally they are still busy thinking, planning and calculating for the working of the next year.",0,Maybe you are right.,0
2778,"Hey Sarah, are you all right? You look upset. As a matter of fact, I am a bit upset. I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well. What happened? No one would listen to any of my suggestions. Instead, they just kept arguing with each other.",0,Who was chairing the meeting?,0
2779,"Bob. Well, I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes. That's exactly what happened! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say. Then he expected everyone to agree with him. What was the meeting about?",0,We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient.,0
2780,"It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient. Exactly. I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share, but they just wouldn't let me finish. What should I have done to get my point across? You have to keep things short and sweet. When you get a chance to speak, try not to get into too many unnecessary details. Short and sweet? But what if I have to explain something complicated?",0,You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting. Not everyone needs to know all that information.,0
2781,"Let's go to the cinema tonight, shall we? Good idea. Is there a good movie on? What about ' Farewell My Concubine '? I've been wanting to see it for a long time. All right. But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose.",0,My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening.,0
2782,I’ d love to have my own farm. It would be very hard work. Are you sure? I wouldn’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy. Running a farm would be totally different to you current job.,0,That’ s one reason I’ d like to try it. I’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office.,0
2783,"Good afternoon, everyone. The experiment is to start at 3. Have you gone through the instructions? Yes, sir. Ok, now some points for attention. First of all, pay attention to safety... Now, sign your names on the lab record, and after that you can start. If there is any question, just let me know. Excuse me, sir. This air compressor doesn't work.",0,Have you turned it on?,0
2784,"Oh man! I’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven’ t lost an ounce! Are you trying to lose weight? Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid. I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven’ t lost any weight! Look at these love handles. You don’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight. I think that’ s where you’ re going wrong.",0,"Why? If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?",0
2785,"Not really. You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats. Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors. So you are saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat? Yes! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol. You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish. If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks?",0,Don’ t count on it.,0
2786,"Do you know that song? Which song? The song you hear now. No, I've never heard of this song before. It's beautiful! Who sing it?",4,Elvis Presley. Don't you recognize his voice?,0
2787,"How are you? Fine. I haven’ t seen you for several days. Oh, I have been with my uncle for a week.",0,What’ s he doing?,0
2788,"What did you do this weekend, Kate? Oh, Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday. That sounds nice. Where did you go? We drove to the lake and had a picnic. We had a great time! How about you? Did you do anything special?",4,Not really. I just worked on my car all day.,0

2790,"Hey, Mike. Can I ask you something? Sure, what's up? I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight. Who do you think will win? Good question. I have to think about it.",0,My husband is betting on France.,0
2791,"How do you do. I’ m Mark Rancor. Nice to meet you. May I know your name, please? I’ m Rose Teller. I think I’ Ve seen you somewhere before?",0,"Ah, yes. I remember now. Were you Mr. John’ s dinner partner last month?",0

2793,"What’ s “ pi ”? That’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, I think. I see. What is that ratio exactly? It’ s approximately 3.14, but the number continues forever. What’ s the diameter of your circle?",0,"It’ s 10 centimeters, so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters.",0
2794,"Ok. My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars. What’ s the exchange rate at the moment? According to the newspaper, the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound. That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars. What’ s the next question.",0,Fractions. What’ s a quarter and an eighth? That’ s three-eights. Easy. The next question is “ what are prime numbers? ”.,0
2795,"I can help you there. Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers, apart from the number itself and 1, together. So, 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers, but 4 isn’ t because 2 * 2 = 4. Exactly. Anything else? How many seconds in an hour? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether.",0,You’ ll be a mathematician one day.,0
2796,"How's your new car? Perfect. Couldn't be better! You made a good choice, then? It's just what I wanted.",4,No regrets?,0
2797,"Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing. Don't worry about it, Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know, Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture. Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm, by the way, what do you do about tipping in China? We don't. No tipping?

2798,"Morning, Mary. I haven't seen you in a long time. What's up? Oh, I took up a new hobby. So you don't travel a lot now? No, Frank. I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now.",4,It's certainly a popular hobby. I know a lot of people love stamps.,4
2799,"It certainly is. It's so much fun. I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right? Absolutely. Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world. Well, every stamp has a story to tell.",4,You're right. And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps.,4
2800,"Good. Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections. There's a lot to share when you have a common interest. Yes, it's really amazing. I got to go now. I'm meeting with some other collectors.",4,"Ok, good luck. See you",4
2801,"What a beautiful view, my sweetheart! It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece. No man could ever make anything like this. What is that below? It is the Colorado River. You will go down the river in a boat if you wish.",0,"No, thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me.",0
2802,What's the matter? You don't look well. I am worried. What about? My exam.,0,"Oh, is that all?",0

2807,"Betty, would you please read this letter of application I've just written? I'd like to have your opinion. I'd be glad to tell you what I think. Good! I'm interested in your advice. If I were you, I would change the beginning. You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities.",0,"Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?",4
2808,"Well, everything is packed and ready to go. It's hard to believe that we're really leaving. The past two weeks was like a dream. Yes.

2809,Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street? Of course. That was the best pasta I've ever had. I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day. If only we could eat there once more!,4,Maybe we can come here again next summer.,4

2812,"What are the seasons like in your city? Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time. Winters are short, but cold, wet, and windy. I love the summers in my city, but I hate the wintertime. Does it ever rain in summer? We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, but apart from that, summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, so most people don’ t mind then.",0,What are spring and autumn like?,0
2813,"I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, sometimes warm. It’ s usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny an Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, so our summertime is your wintertime, and vice versa. We get some rain in every season, but most is in winter.

That should give you enough time to have a quick shower. where will I be staying? we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings, so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system. that's very sensible.

2821,"Terrible. How about people's lives? Fortunately, there is no person died. That's great. It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake. Yeah. Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world.",0,That's why many people died in the earthquake.,0
2822,"Well, China is located on the Eurasia plate, where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other. Oh, China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history. Yeah, we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman. We're all familiar with natural disasters. but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake.",4,"Right.

In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted. In rugby, players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates, don’ t they? That’ s right.

2908,"No. Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family. Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller.

2909,"But four boys! It will be a new experience, and you might as well learn to adjust to changes. You are right, I guess.The world keeps changing, and so do families. But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else. That's what I want. It is good to have goals in life. If California doesn't work out, come and visit me in Korea, OK?",0,That's a great idea!,0
2910,"Hello, Kate. Hi, Peter. I didn't see you last night. Where did you go? I was almost on line the whole night. Did you play network games the whole night?",0,"No, I listened to the music, too.",0
2911,"Ma, I really don't know how to thank you. I'm glad I was able to help. It's most kind of you. Don't mention it. It was the least I could do.",4,"If there's ever anything I can do for you, Don't hesitate to let me know.",4
2912,"Hey, Mary, can you cut that out? Cut what out I’ m not doing anything. The tapping of your pen on your desk. It’ s driving me crazy. Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup!",1,"I don’ t slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you’ re shouting into your phone all the time?",0
2913,"what do you think about all the different diets people go on? I don't think dieting is good for you. It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with! but what do you think about people who are obese? What should they do to lose weight? they need to eat healthy foods, but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day. They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.",0,so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?,0
2914,"sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small desert. how about drinking soda? many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever. If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda, try that's good advice. Have you ever tried taking vitamins?",0,"my mother used to make me take vitamins every day, but I don't take them anymore. Vitamins are good as a supplement, but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start.",0
2915,"John, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a personal question. I don't mind at all. All right. Are you married? To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single.",0,"Then, when do you plan to get married?",0
2916,"Bob, put on your shoes, your feet are really smelly. No foot gives out scent. But don't forget you are in a cafe. Never mind, the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed.",0,I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior.,1
2917,"hey Ayden, I was wondering if you could do me a favor. that depends. What is it? it's kind of a big favor. I'm absolutely flat broke, and I owe my landlady $ 200. she's given me until Friday to give it to her, but I don't get paid until next Monday. Do you think you could loans I'd love to help you out, but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well. I had to get a new engine put into my car, and that ate up my savings.",0,"if you can't give me the full amount, a fraction of it would still help. I'll pay you back on Monday. I promise.",0
2918,"let's see, I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend. I can only spare about $ 20. I would give you more if I had it, I just don't have much money to my name right now. thanks a lot Ayden. Every little bit will help. Tell you what, if you aren't doing anything tonight, why don't you come over and have dinner at my place. that'd be great. Thanks! What time should I come over? how about at 6 pm?",0,see you then!,4
2919,"I'm going over to the gym. I want to do some running. Why don't you run outside? Are you kidding? Do you know how cold it is today? Yeah, I suppose. I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather.",0,"No, it's not. Not at all. I'd probably freeze my lungs.",0
2920,"Wait for me a minute. I'll go over to the gym too. You? Yes, why not? Just let me get my gym clothes together. I didn't know you could exercise.",0,What do you mean by that? Everyone can exercise!,0
2921,"Yeah, I know. But you? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth. No, not at all. I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training. They have decent equipment at that gym. You're going to lift weights? Hah! Are you laughing at me?",0,I'm sorry. I just can't imagine you lifting weights.,0
2922,"Maybe not. But I want to start. I need to get in shape. I feel these past couple months that my energy is low. It's true. If a person doesn't exercise, they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running. Even in the winter. So I need to do something too. But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise.",0,"I know. But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles, and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool. How does that sound?",0
2923,I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place! There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite? Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?,0,No way! Do you have a flavors you don't like?,0
2924,"I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it. I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once. I think that would be horrible!",2,I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!,4
2925,"I heard that ben is forming his own band. it will be a rock and roll band probably. He’ s a very good guitarist. can you play a musical instrument? If you can, he might ask you to join the band. I can play drums, but I haven’ t played for a while. I’ m not sure I’ d be good enough to play in a band.",0,I wish I could play a musical instrument. I love music.,0
2926,"Hey, Frank, there is that Janet Check. Wow, what a great burd! She sure knows how to strut her stuff. She's a real turn-on our rights.",0,And look out she's dressed.,0
2927,"Yeah, I noticed. She must be really loaded. No way. Her old man is rich. He buys her anything she wants. Lucky her. Anyway, I think that is just as beautiful. I think you've lost it.",0,"Well, that's my opinion.",0
2928,Who is Cindy’ s husband? Cindy’ s husband is Ron. How many children do Cindy and Ron have? They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law.,0,Do they have any grandchildren?,0
2929,"Yes, they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys. Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws? Yes, she gets along with them quite well. Do they have a large family?",0,Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron’ s family.,0
2930,"Where do you live, Kim? I live in an apartment downtown. Oh, that's convenient, but... how much crime is there? Not much. But there is a lot of traffic. I can't stand the noise sometimes! Where do you live?",0,. I have a house in the suburbs.,0
2931,did you get my email? I certainly did. Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend? sure. how did the business trip go?,0,"well, to be honest, nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss.",2
2932,"I understand. The last time I went on a business trip with the boss, I didn't even have enough to eat! I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses. I spent half of the weekend on a train! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets! our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes. I see. Well, then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip. It was really tiring for me.",0,I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today.,4
2933,"Hello! Is that the box-office? Yes. I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening, please.",0,"Just a minute please. Oh, I'm sorry, all the tickets for tonight have been sold out.",0
2934,"What a pity! How about tomorrow evening? Oh, you're lucky, there are just two tickets left. Do you want to take them? Wonderful, I'll take them. OK, your name and telephone number please.",0,Wang Min. Telephone number is 13811658. Can I pick the tickets this afternoon?,0
2935,I really like the book you lent me the other day. I'm glad you like it. And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long. Not at all.,4,Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting.,4
2936,"You’ re a wonderful person, Kathleen. So you are. And I’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn’ t truly worthy. I feel exactly the same way with you.",0,"Don’ t, don’ t, don’ t, don’ t say that. That, that makes it worse.",0
2937,"What? You don’ t love me? Me, either. You don’ t love me? No. But we’ re so right for each other.",0,"I know, I know. Well, is there some, is there someone else? Oh, that woman on television, Sydney Ann.",0
2938,"Mary, can you help me set the table? Sure. This is usually my chore. I don't mind helping.",0,We need to set the table for four.,0
2939,"Shall we go to cinema this evening? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing. It’ s supposed to be really good. What kind of movie is it? I don’ t like many of his movies, actually. It’ s a thriller. It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead. I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts, so it might be interesting. I read a review today and the critic didn’ t seem to be very impressed.",0,What did the critic say?,0
2940,"What are your hobbies, Mr. Green? I like collecting stamps. But it's an expensive hobby, isn't it? Yes, you're right. What do you like to do in your spare time?",0,I usually play chess with my friends. But I like playing basketball best.,0
2941,"Are you satisfied with the dishes? Great, the lamb stew tastes incredible. I like it, too. I like the fish especially. It's so fresh, and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish. Yes, the food here deserves its reputation. Chinese food is one of my favorites 。",4,"If you like, I'll take you to a new restaurant next time, I just heard about it from my friend, and he was just raving about it. It's such a great Sichuan cuisine. Would you like to try that?",4
2942,"Hey Michelle. Good to see you. Are you at lunch? Oh hi Jim. No I just got back. I thought you were on vacation now. No, I wish I was! I just got back from Spain actually. Oh wonderful! Have you been there before or was it your first time?",4,"My first time. I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain. It was amazing, and the weather was just beautiful! No rain, and just sun, sun, sun...",4
2943,"That looks like an interesting book. It is. It’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world, with brief descriptions of how they were build, their purpose, and so on. There are the pymeids. It’ s easy to see how they got that name! they don’ t have smooth sides though. They don’ t now, but most of them did originally. There’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States. It’ s very distinctive with its five sides.",0,Look at that cylindrical office building. I’ Ve never been seen one that shape before.,0
2944,Yes. Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape. Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top. They’ re not perfectly cylindrical. This is the world’ s largest sports stadium. It’ s a massive oval. What sports do they play there?,0,It says here that it’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings.,0
2945,"Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space? No, the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them. But not too much. As the space between galaxies expands, it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough. But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy. If galaxies are moving apart from each other, how can they collide? Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide. However, on average, when you compare two large enough chunks of space, the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other.",0,"Wow, you're really informative. Thanks a lot.",4
2946,"Isn’ t he the best instructor? I think * he’ s so hot. Wow! I really feel energized, don’ t you? I swear, I’ m going to kill you for this. What’ s wrong? Didn’ t you think it was fun?! Oh, yeah! I had a blast! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad. Sorry, I’ m just not into this health kick.",0,"Oh, no, get off it. It wasn’ t such a killer class. You just have to get into it. Like they say, no pain, no gain.",0
2947,"Do you have any hobbies? Yes. I like gardening. Oh, that's interesting. Do you have a garden? Yes, follow me. Here it is.",4,Your garden is really lovely.,4
2948,"Thank you. Do you take care of them everyday? Yes, I do. Don't you feel dull?",0,I don't. I like the work.,0
2949,"Do you have much experience with kids? Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson. To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby. I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.",0,What about your mother? Did she help you?,0
2950,"Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’ s it. I had to care for them most of the time. I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day. Don’ t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work. Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.",0,"No. You see, I went back to school to get my Master’ s Degree when I was in my thirties. You won’ t be older than that.",0
2951,"Hey, Daniel, how's it going? Hey, Daddy, today I had really a fantastic history class. Wow, it's so strange for you to say things like that. What had happened? We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean. He is a real great navigator.",0,Did your teacher tell you the route he took?,0
2952,"Yeah, he, with his fleet, came across the Indian Ocean, and arrived at the east coast of Africa. Great, do you still remember when he started his voyage? Of course, that is from 1405 to 1433, which is in Ming dynasty. Good, by the way, do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you?",0,"Not yet, you know I have a lot of homework to do.",0
2953,"You should speed up, because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today. OK, great Daddy, after supper, I'll embark on it. That's my boy! Wait, Daniel, when is Pirates of the Caribbean on? Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow, who wants to find the treasure on the sea?",4,"Exactly, now, tell me the time.",4
2954,"Most of our customers are foreigners. How many foreign languages can you speak, Elizabeth? Two. French and Spanish. And how well can you speak them? Well, French was my best subject at school. I can read and write it pretty well.",0,And how about your Spanish?,0
2955,He has lots of hobbies. And he’ s always busy with his pictures and roses. He’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses. But as for his business in the city...,0,He lets his cousins look after his business.,0

2957,"Where are we headed now? To a historic coffeehouse. It's got a little Mafia story to it. Awesome. Was someone killed there? Oh, yeah, while he was eating, and he was a pretty famous Don.",0,Cool! Is it safe for us to eat there though?,4
2958,"How is everything going with your girlfriend? Didn't I tell you? It's over! Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I did't know that you had split up. What happened? It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up!",1,Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?,6
2959,"No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home! What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her? I wanted to, but I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, so I decided to just go home. I called her later that the night, but she didn't answer the phone. I can't believe she would do that to you. It's so dishonest-and rude!",0,I know. I still haven't heard from her. The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around.,1
2960,"How do you usually spend your leisure time? I mean, do you have any special interests out of your job? Of course. You see, almost everyone has some kind of hobby. Yeah, you’ re quite right and what’ s your hobby? I like taking photos out of doors.",0,"Oh, photography, It’ s really a good hobby.",4
2961,Have we handed out all the water? Yes. So what else to do now? Nothing. The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later. I see. How do you like the game?,0,"Terrific. There is one girl said, It is the best game I've ever watched.",0
2962,"Who do you think do better? Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, but also he inspired the whole team. Exactly. He is unbelievable. On the other hand, I think the other team won everyone's respect. The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning, but they just carried on and never lost their cool.",0,They were really tough.,0
2963,Let's do something different today. Like how? I would like you to give me a different hair style. What did you have in mind?,0,Give me a short haircut.,0
2964,Do you know how short you want your hair to be? I want you to cut it to a few inches long. That's pretty short. Are you sure about this? I've had this idea for some time now.,0,"I'm going to do it, but you have to be sure you really want me to.",0
2965,"I am thinking about resigning from my current job. Have you thought about it seriously? Yes, I have been thinking about it for quite a while. Now I finally make up my mind to leave. I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday. Ok, did you find a new company?",0,"Yes, I will move on to XYZ Company.",0
2966,"Hi, Francis. Oh, Mike. How are you doing? Not bad. It seems you are super yogurt lover. You have so many in your cart. Well, I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks. Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it? It tastes great and very healthy too.",0,"Oh, I haven’ t noticed that before. Maybe I will try next time.",0
2967,Hi! What are you watching? It’ s a program about islam. It’ s very interesting. Wow! So many people! Where are they and what are they doing? They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca. Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ”.,0,Why do they go there?,0
2968,"Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life. Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith. When muslims pray, they face towards mecca. That’ s right. Unfortunately, so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed. I heard about that. The pilgrims must walk around a large, sacred black stone.",0,"That’ s right. That’ s when accidents often happen. The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims, to reduce the chances of accidents.",0
2969,"Pilgrimages are common in many faiths. Yes. In England, Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages. Isn’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed? I think that place is Lourdes. There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there.",0,Do you think that there is something magical about that place?,0
2970,"Why do you want to go to the U. S.? I want to enrich my knowledge in management. The United States is an ideal place for me. What will you do when you come home? Before I work in the office, I was a teacher. So if possible, I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people.",0,Do you feel your English is good enough for the course?,0
2971,"Yes. You know, English is my present working language. Besides, I scored very high in TOEFL. Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States? I will support myself. In recent years, I have saved enough money for my study in the U. S. How long do you expect to stay there?",0,I will be there for three years.,0
2972,I don't know what to say. This can't be happening. Here's the obituary. It's really there? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare. But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work. Poor Femi. Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him.,5,This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five.,0
2973,"Dear Anna. I really love you. I love you, too. I want to take care of you forever. Will you marry me? Oh. My God! Are you serious?",6,Am I too abrupt? Did I scare you? Or you don't want...,4
2974,"No! I have been expecting this moment for a long time. I mean my answer is ' yes '. Oh, I'm so happy. I will try my best to love you and protect you. I promise. I trust you. We'll be happy. Let me wear you this diamond ring.",4,It's so beautiful.,4
2975,"The Spring Festival is drawing close. By then we will have five days off. I am expecting it. Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival? Just like you celebrate Christmas, we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day, the Spring Festival. It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together. Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year.",0,"Christmas has more religious nature, while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday. On the New Year's Eve, we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner '. One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings. After that, the adults usually sit chatting, watching TV, or playing cards.",0
2976,"What are the children doing? They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks. I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year. Perhaps it is like what people told you. At 24 hours midnight, the time when the New Year really comes, we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other, and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper, in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money.",0,Who will get the money?,0
2977,We’ re going to the movies. Will you join us? I’ m very sorry I can’ t. Why not? I’ m afraid I have some business to attend to.,0,Then would you like to have lunch with us?,4
2978,"I’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now. Would you like me to give you a lift? No, thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there. Come on. It’ s no trouble at all.",4,"Ok, thank you.",4
2979,"Are your ready to go to the supermarket? Yes, are you? I've got my money and my keys, so I'm ready. You do know that it's absolutely freezing out, don't you? I'd put a coat on if I were you.",0,It wasn't cold out this morning.,0
2980,"Well, it's started raining since then. Look out the window! It's pouring rain out there! Well, I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then, as well. Have a look outside for me. Does that look like hail to you? It does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.",0,That's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.,4
2981,Ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here. How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know. The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night. Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse.,0,I don't think we have anything to worry about. Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well?,0
2982,"At the Beijing Olympics, all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals. A clean sweep again! Yes. All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport. Do you know any secrets to China's success? In the first place, I think the whole nation is just fond of the game. It is well grounded with the mass. With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong, we can always spot a handful of potential world champions.",0,"So, the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership.",0
2983,"Sure. There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams, and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules. For example? They are subject to hard training. And you know what, for a player on the national team, personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions. They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other. Oh, dear! It's an encroachment on individual rights!",0,"Well, ping-pong is our national sport, and we just have to keep winning one honor after another. That's why many people think such rules acceptable. After all, they are funded out of taxpayers'money.",0
2984,"I can’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice! Why not! It’ s a classic. In fact, it’ s one of my favorite novels. But it’ s so old. Don’ t judge a book by its cover. Do you Kwon what it’ s about?",0,"No, not at all.",0
2985,"First of all, it’ s a romance novel, set in the early 19th century. I didn’ t realize it was a romance novel. What’ s the main storyline? It’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls. Why does he want to do that?",0,"Since he doesn’ t have a son, he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man. That way, all of his daughters will be cared for.",0
2986,"Won’ t they get his inheritance? No, that’ s the problem. Though they are well-off, once he dies, his house will go to his cousin. So, when he dies, the girls will have nothing. I see. This sounds interesting! Maybe my teacher isn’ t so horrible after all. So, are you going to read the novel or watch the movie?",0,There’ s movie? My teacher didn’ t tell me that!,6
2987,"Hello! Hi, Jenny! Jason here. It's great to hear your voice again. Hi, Jason! Long time no see. How's the hotel? It's pretty nice, but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon. Hotel living is not for me.",0,I know what you mean.,0
2988,"How about you? When are you leaving for Berkeley? I am leaving in two weeks. So soon! Well, I'd really like to see you again before you leave. Would you like to go out with me on Friday? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards. Oh, I am sorry, Jason. I've already got plans for Friday evening. How about Saturday?",0,Saturday is fine. I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o’ clock. Is that ok?,0
2989,When do you want to have the open house party? How about next Friday? Friday sounds good. How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids?,0,I like that. Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax.,4
2990,"I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand. me. too i like the festival best of all. Think of the big face down the eve, hmm. And special TV programs, fire crackers and the games to play.",0,"Hey, do you know any mystery belief serve the festival?",0
2991,Such as... You know why fire crackers are set off in festival. Why? to welcome the new year of course. And also to frighten away evil spirits.,0,Really?,6

2993,"go on, read it out loud. ok. It says, "" Dear Jessica. It was so good to receive you letter. I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease...

2996,"Holly, I just heard some terrible news. Me, too. I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor. What? No, I heard that he has stomach cancer. His ex-girlfriend said it.

2997,"Hi, Kate. Hi, Don. What a surprise! Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn’ t sure. We haven’ t seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now.

Join my class next week.,0

3001,"Thanks for inviting me to your friend’ s wedding. I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony. Is that common? Well, some people use a standard set of words, but many couples today write their own wedding vows. Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting, but it didn't look like real rice to me. It wasn't. It was birdseed. We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it.",0,"Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, music and dancing, and interesting traditions.",0

I woke up this morning and found it was sunny. So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me. We were going to look for a new purse. Now it turned out to be like this. Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore. That’ s too bad. I hate sand storms too. It can be worse than any kind of bad weather. What’ s wrong with climate? Anyway, I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before. Can’ t people do something to stop it?",0,"It is not an easy job. The government is working on it.

It is all over now. How was it going, anyway?",0,"I don’ t know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn’ t ask those as I expected.

3029,"Yes, of course. Didn't you know that? No, I didn't. How high is the tax? Well, it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal. Why would the government want to tax liquor so much?",0,"Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also, it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it, the government thinks it has the right to tax it.",0
3030,"What do you plan to do on Sunday morning? Nothing special. How about going to English corner with me? Oh, I'd rather not.",0,Why not?,0

3039,"Well, what did you get in English 101 last year? I got a 4.0 in that class. Well, I can't compare to you. I got a 3.1 in English 101. That means if you got a lower grade in English 201, it must be harder. It's not what it appears. I actually tried harder in the 101 class. If I put as much effort into the 201 class, I would have received the same grade.",0,Oh. That helps. Thanks.,0

3046,"Think nothing of it, Tony. I’ m sure you’ d do the same for me. Could you tell me a bit more about the work there? I mean, those dos and don'ts. I am a green hand, you know.

3048,"What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday? Do you think it was worth the investment to go? Yeah, I really got a lot of the session. The workshop topic was resolving personal problems. It was led by a professional human resources director. The teacher had a lot of experience, and I think we were all given a really good base to start with. The workshop was only one afternoon long, do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours? It depends on the topic, the teacher, and the way the course is set up. Yesterday, even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues, the workshop got us all thinking. We learned some very basic, but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues.",0,Sounds like you really learned a lot.,0

3051,"I think I tried every position, but the last few years, I played third base. I hate third base. It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast. It was scary at first, but after awhile, I got used to it. If you have fast reflexes, then it's not really a problem. What position did you play? I played outfield. I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces.",0,"I wish I could play again, but there isn't much opportunities around here.",0

Well, it was not like a normal English League match. No, it wasn't. Rather, it looked like a Bundesliga match, where physical contact is so frequent. English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it. Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent.

You always give such amazing presentations, I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow. Sure, it's easy. First of all, the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple. People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans.

What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation? Do you think I should use PowerPoint? You should consider the size and interests of your audience.

3168,"I know education is expensive, but it's been my lifelong dream. Call me crazy, but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name. Well, getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school. Can you afford that? Can you survive that? I certainly can't afford it, but I'm sure I could find some good student loans. I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling. It's not as romantic as you might think.",0,Yeah...

I think they must have horrible lives. All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do. They must get sick of it. I bet they love it really.

Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film? Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’ s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’ s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting. I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.",0,"Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’ s a G-rated movie! It’ s for the kids! It’ s not a thriller!",6
3228,"Well, that’ s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it’ s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’ s just too cliche. How can it be cliche? It’ s a fable! It’ s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love. You have always been so soft, Dave! Open your heart Dick. Don’ t shut us out.",0,"Anyway... That’ s all for today folks!

The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it. It sounds great, and is it really cool there? Yes, I think the reason is that there is a big lake, and many trees in the Resort.

I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border.",0,I don't know. I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer.

3305,"Www, man! In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’ s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect. Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now? Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many.

3347,"So would I. what other unusual plants did they show? They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, when the insect collects the nectar, it also takes some pollen from one flower to another. That’ s very specialized. So, the insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, the other would too. That’ s right. That’ s one reason why it’ s so important to protect every species.",0,I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.,0

3361,"What did you do? I talked to her for a while, but she’ s really depressed. So, I made an appointment with the school counselor for her. That’ s a good idea. The counselor is a psychologist. He’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things. Yeah, that’ s what I told her. I’ m glad she’ s reaching out for help, instead of trying to deal with this on her own.",0,"Yeah, me too.",0
3362,It’ s rather cold. Isn’ t it Oh. Yes. It is Shall I light the stove? That’ s a good idea,0,Well. What’ s the climate like in your country?,0

I got home I had a headache, so I had to go straight to bed. But I was over-tired, because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours. What a shame.

3374,"About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library. I see. It's almost 5:00 PM now, don't you think there will be a lot of traffic? Oh, we're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes. Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.",0,"I take the subway to work everyday, so I'm used to it now.",0
3375,"Doesn't your mother live in the city? Yes, she's lived there for about ten years. I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then. I know what you mean. It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.",0,"Have a good time. Next time you're free, give me a call and we'll go play poker.",4
3376,"The time has come to say goodbye. So soon. It seems as if you just got here. I feel that way, too. But all good things must come to an end, as they say.

3380,"Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today? From my own experience as a career woman, I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be, it is still a widespread problem. Society is changing, but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks. do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs? Or are there more issues coming into play? I think it's a very complicated issue. A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers. Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system. Men have power, so it's easier for them to stay in power.",0,What about affirmative action? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy?,0

Let’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing. All right, we are here at the eighth hole. It’ s a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

3384,"I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others. I think I could take better notes and read a little more.

3388,"the second one sounds rather difficult to answer. What did you tell her?

How did she react? she told me that even when I become a senior engineer, I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team.",0,what do you think about her as a boss?,0
3389,"she's pretty easy to get along with. She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally. you're lucky. Not everyone has such a great boss! that's true. She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company. when you find out you get the promotion or not, let me know.",0,I will do.,0
3390,"Has the game started yet? Yeah, about 5 minutes ago. Who's winning? The Bulls, of course!",0,"What! That wasn't a foul! C’ mon, ref!",6

3395,"Yes, whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most. All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World. Was it built before the In dynasty?

3409,"There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong. The city is so bright at night, with all the neon signs. I like it. It makes the city feel alive. I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans. I think that there are too many of them. I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising. They should have lower prices instead. Then they would see more. I see your point, but if companies didn’ t spend money on advertising, no one would hear about their products. I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying. I don’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying.",0,I really hate receiving spam.

I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs, when...",0

Did you see it clearly? Did it attack you?,0
3415,"I don't know about you, but I am famished. Are you interested in getting a bite to eat? That sounds great. I'm absolutely starving! What kind of food are you in the mood for?

Well, I'm really worried about my grades. I didn't think this course would be so stressful.",5,You're a good student. I'm sure you can do well. What you need to do is to relax.,0
3424,You're probably right. I just wish it were that simple. How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time? Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress. I don't really have time to learn anything new. I need to spend my time studying! You need to take some breaks throughout the day. Studying all day isn’ t very usually effective.,0,You’ re right.

3428,"Well, it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have. Why don't you re-take the class next year? That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester? I didn't do that well either. I ended up with a 3.2 this semester. That drops my total GPA to 3.45.",0,My GPA is pretty similar to yours. I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class.,0
3429,What was your GPA before this semester? I was sitting happy with a 3.4. Why did it go down so much? Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class.,0,What happened to you?,0

3549,"you're right, but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering. what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue? quite a number. Actually every skyscraper has a history. A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center. It's a landmark what's there after that?",4,"well then, there's a Central Park. Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world.",4
3550,"Hi, Daisy! Hi Simon. Nice to meet you again I hope you are Settling in at school! I am! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses.",4,Good! Me too! By the way. you didn't tell me what you are studying here.,0
3551,Didn't I? I'm doing business studies. Really? That's great. You hope to join a company after graduating? Maybe. My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born. We are living in Toronto. Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate. It's too soon to say really. What about your friend Zoe,0,She's from Australia. She lives in Sydney. Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy.,0
3552,"Accountancy? Really? She must be very good at figures. I guess so. What about you, Simon? I'm studying law. Great! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer.",4,"Sure, welcome anytime",4
3553,"Emily, are you getting rushed by a sorority? More than one. I think the count is now three, if I remember correctly. Wow. I'm getting rushed too, but just one. Are you thinking of joining any of them? I don't know. I know there are advantages to joining, but I'm not much into group stuff.",0,The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group.,0
3554,"Are you studying any languages here? Yes, I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department. What are you majoring in? I'm majoring in English.",0,Is it difficult to learn?,0
3555,"Yes. The language is hard to learn, but it's interesting. Do you know anything about Britain and America? I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture. Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well.",0,You're right.,0
3556,"How are you? I'm fine thanks. How about you? I'm okay. What are you doing these days? Not a lot, actually. Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia. I may have to go to KL in a few weeks.",0,That's great. When are you starting?,0

3559,"Hello Mike! Would you like a drink? No, thank you. I had too much to drink yesterday evening. I had a bad hangover this morning. My head felt terrible. Were you celebrating something? Yes. It was a friend’ s birthday party. We drank all kinds of things-beer, wine and spirits. After midnight, we were even drinking cocktails!",4,It’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks. You should stick with one for the whole evening.,0
3560,"I know, but it was a celebration, you Kwon? I don’ t think I’ Ve see you drunk. I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints. You are a sensible drinker. Anyway, I’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening. I don’ t’ want another bad hangover. Let me buy you a soft drink then. How about a coke?",0,Yeah. That’ s a good idea. I heard that coke was first used as a medicine.,0
3561,"Rally?... barman!... a large coke with ice and lemon, please... thanks. Here’ s the money. Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow? Yes. I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine... ... and taste a few! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not.",0,Yes. I’ m looking forward to it.,0
3562,"Excuse me, do you know where the visa office is? Yes, I do. I’ ll walk you there. Thanks! Are you applying to study or work abroad?",0,I want to study abroad.,0

It’ s not you, it’ s me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for! So, what are you saying? You’ re breaking up with me because I’ m perfect? Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ ll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I’ d only hurt you, I know I’ d only make you cry.",0,"Baby, come on. Don’ t do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don’ t leave me.",0
3570,"Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts? No. What? He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail. No. Really, what happened?",6,"Well, it was all a big mistake, actually. He got home on Friday night really late, and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients, so he was really drunk.",0
3571,"Was he out with the guys from the bank? Yes, I think so. Oh, yeah, they always get really drunk. Well, anyway, he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, so he couldn't get in. He lives alone, you know.",0,"Oh, really. I thought he lived with his wife.",6
3572,"No, she left him last year. Oh, really? Do you know why? Hang on, let me finish telling you what happened. Where was I? He lost his wallet and keys.",0,"Oh yes, well, he tried to climb in through the bathroom window, but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot. The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress, so they called the police.",0
3573,"Oh, no. Yes. So when the cops arrived, they didn't believe his story So then what happened? Well, when he sobered up, he called someone from work to come and bail him out.",0,"Well, that's a bit of a tricky situation.",0
3574,"What's your opinion about childless couples? Will you choose to have no kids? To be honest, I wouldn't. Why? Do you have to make a choice now? Not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.",0,What's the puzzle?,0
3575,"My husband and I prefer to have no kids, but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids. Oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way. Yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night. Oh, really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.",6,But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.,0
3576,"Definitely. You know, I often overhear our neighbor, the young couple, fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness. Don't worry. I think in most cases, children are the glue that keeps a family together. I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child.",0,Sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.,0
3577,"You’ re a big fan of Andy Lau, aren’ t you? Yes, I’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD. I adore him. He’ s my idol. How come you don’ t have all of his films on DVD? Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays, especially the ones where he only played a bit part.",0,I see. I’ m sure you’ ll find them one day. I see you also have several poster of him.,0
3578,"Yes. These posters are new. I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday. Are you a member of his fan club? I was, but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet, so I’ m not a member now. Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month?",0,Of course! I bought two copies.,4
3579,"How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger’ s ”? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet. Oh, it was great. We had seafood buffet. They do one every Friday. The waiters and waitresses are very good. They are very attentive, but don’ t hang around the table. I like the buffets they have, but if often order a la carte, because I don’ t feel extremely hungry. I like the wine list there too. Yes, so do I. they have wines from all over the world. There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket. We ordered some Australian red wine, which tasted delicious and wasn’ t expensive.",0,"Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage, but the don’ t do that at “ ginger’ s ”. what was included in the seafood buffet?",0
3580,"They had almost every kind of seafood. There were oyster, shrimp, prawns, crabs, and fish. I ate a lot of smoked salmon. Did they have lobster? No, they didn’ t. you could order it from the menu. I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet. Yes, it probably is. I don’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants. You never know whether they are fresh.",0,"I know. I didn’ t eat any, but a few people in our group did and no one got sick.",0
3581,"Hello there! Come on in! Don’ t just stand there! Come and take a seat! Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy. Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks! Okay. Um... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.",0,"Don’ t you worry, I’ ll take care of everything! Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It’ s so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!",4
3582,what do you think about this store? I heard it’ s a posh store that’ s only got branches in big cities. I love this store. The only problem is that it’ s extremely expensive. don’ t worry. I’ Ve decided that for your birthday I’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress. really? I thought you hated shopping?,4,"I do, that’ s why you should appreciate this gift!",4
3583,"sure. That’ s really nice of you. Let’ s go in and try some things on. how about this red dress? I think it would really suit you. that’ s gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8? here you go.On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it’ s on special offer today.",4,I think this color isn’ t quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white?,4
3584,"Judy, what is everybody talking about? Haven’ t you heard? Richard was fired by our manager. You’ re kidding. It can’ t be true. Believe it or not. Everybody is talking about it in the company.",0,Really? I’ m surprised.,6
3585,"Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods? It could be. There are floods in this country almost every year, but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent. It seems that the climate in this country is changing. The summers are hotter. The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years. There have also been stronger winds.",0,I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment.,0
3586,"I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers. Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsborg is less than $ 1. Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you? It's fashionable.",0,"Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.",0
3587,"Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun. How? By drinking? Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed. When did you begin to drink?",0,"It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink? '",0
3588,"hello, Deva, how are you? can't complain. What about you? not bad. Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband? I've heard. She looks quite depressed.",0,Yes. They used to be joined at the hip.,0
3589,"I heard they were just married for 5 months. yes, she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things. yeah. Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden. you said it. You know, they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage.",0,maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married.,0
3590,"Here's Copellini's, my cousin's store. Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end. Admit it. You just think of Mussolini. No, I'm an art lover, so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli!",0,"Ah, yes. The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body.",0
3591,"Thanks for the pizza. It was delicious. It's okay. Next time, it's on me. Don't be silly.",0,I'm serious.,0
3592,"I really admire you, Diana. Why, Jerry? Your words just came out of the blue. You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school. I work very hard and that's it, you know, practice makes perfect.",0,Isn't there anything else?,0
3593,"I have no idea. You must have a high IQ score. Well, Jerry, let me tell you a secret. Go ahead.",0,My IQ score is slightly above average.,0
3594,"Seriously? But you are such a genius. Maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure. Well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ. You can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks.",0,"OK, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming?",0
3595,"What does this have to do with me? You know all about coffee. I need your advice, so I won't look stupid when I order. Order tea. Isn't that what you like to drink? Come on, Hugh! Tea is for wimps! Please, I need your help.",0,"If you want to be macho, order a double shot of espresso.",0
3596,"Hey, Mike, is Jenny coming with us? Yes. Why? Nothing. I'm just asking. Just asking? But why is your face burning like mad? Ah-huh, someone has a crush on Jenny, doesn't he?",0,Who has a crush?!,0
3597,"Come on, Ted, don't be such a chicken. If you like her, you've got to tell her. Maybe she likes you. Well, I don't have the guts to ask her out. What're you so afraid of? Just tell her what you're feeling about her. I'd totally die if she turned me down.",0,"But that's better than keeping everything to yourself. You've got to let her know. Come on! You've got to take a chance! Even though you are rejected, it's not the end of the world! There's nothing to lose, is there?",0
3598,"Does anyone need a drink? I'll take one. How's the cooler situation? It's still stocked, and there's plenty of ice. Here you are-cheers! Cheers. You guys didn't drive, did you?",0,"No, we walked. Why, do you need us to carry some stuff home later?",0
3599,Would you honor us with a visit? I'd love to. Thanks. When will you be convenient? Any time will suit me.,4,Are you doing anything tomorrow?,4

3601,"Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving? I thought that we could leave around 8 That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara? That was part of my plan.",4,"Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for asking me to go with you.",4
3602,Congratulations on your success in the competition. That is quite something. Thank you. I was lucky this time. I think luck played a very small part in your victory. It is solely due to your hard work and efforts. That brings honor to you and joy to us. I am flattered.,4,It is real word.,0
3603,"Oh! You're engaged! What a beautiful engagement ring! Who to? Of course Mike. Who else? We fell in love at first sight. When's the wedding going to be? We haven't decided yet. There are a lot of things to sort out, you know.",4,Are you having a big wedding?,4

3606,"Those are today’ s top stories. Now let’ s go to John for the weather. John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers? I’ m afraid we’ re in for a rough weekend, Mary. There is a storm system moving through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all day today, and there’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve That’ s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday? Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout",0,That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.,0
3607,"What was the last movie you saw? A Korean film called Friends, starring Sang Dong-gun. Really? I've seen that movie, too. How did you like the movie?",0,I thought it was pretty good.,4
3608,"Now the coals are just right. I can start grilling. Here you go. I made up the burger patties for you. Thanks. Smell the hickory chips? They give the meat a nice, smoky flavor.

3610,"Would you mind if I make a suggestion? Of course not, go ahead. Maybe you should try to quit smoking. You know it is very bad for your health. Well, sure it is. Actually, I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago. I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day. Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day.",0,You have made a big progress. Quitting smoking is not an easy job. But it will be rewarding in the long run.,0
3611,"The Blacks got divorced. Really? Why? Mr. Black has been getting a little on the side. Really? I am surprised. He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife, does he?",0,"No, he doesn't. Anyway, his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time.",0

3613,"really? I thought his parents had died several years ago. they did. He inherited the money form an uncle. I hope he doesn’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government. dying can be very expensive nowadays! What’ s he going to do with it? he said that he would probably invest most of it. He’ s got a well-paid job, so he doesn’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.",0,I had some good financial news yesterday too.,0
3614,"You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment? No, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while. But you two used to do everything together.

3615,"I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out. Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you. I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her. It can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.",0,You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.,0
3616,"Do you love me? I’ m very fond of you. Yes, but do you love me? Why? You mean a lot to me.",0,Why didn’ t you answer my question?,0
3617,"What question? Do you love me? come on, I’ m eager to hear. You know that I care for you. I.. I’ m proud of you. Don’ t cherish your words, dear.",0,I.. I don’ t feel like saying it.,0

3622,"Hey! How was your first day of class? I’ m in level two and I’ m loving my class this semester! It’ s great being in a class of international students! Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester. That’ s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’ s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians! That’ s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

Even though the customs were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think?",0,"I thought the special effects were amazing, but I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.",0
3626,"Did you read the books before you watched the movies? No. did you? Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters. Yes, trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.",0,I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home.,0
3627,"Jill, how do you like your new job? I like it. But how did you know about my new job? I wanted to surprise you.

I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write. I’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally. And you know I can be charming in interviews. Goodbye my penniless days!

3635,"Sorry, it's tails. You lose. Oh, well. So you get the bottom bunk. What about our stereos? It looks like we both brought our stereos. Probably we only have room for one. Your stereo is better than mine. Do you mind if we use yours? No, I don't mind. I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room.",0,Probably we can put one on that counter. And we can put one on the floor by the bed. Over there.,0
3636,"Alright. That's a good plan. What about the desks? We have two desks, one by the window and one by the door? Which one do you want? Well, the desk by the window is nicer, of course. Don't you think? Yes, I agree. So since I got the bottom bunk, why don't you get the desk by the window? That would be more fair.",0,Alright.,0
3637,"I mean, we could flip a coin for it, but I would probably win again. I'm incredibly lucky you know. Especially with girls. Is that right? Yes, that's right. Well, I hope you let me hang out with you then. Maybe I can learn from you.",0,"Oh, certainly. Certainly. I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave.",0
3638,"Are all lucky people so stuck up? C'mon, don't take it seriously! I'm just kidding. Anyway, I get the desk by the window, you get the bottom bunk. That's it. Why don't we start unpacking these boxes?",0,"I will go get something to eat. You unpack first.Then, when I come back, I'll unpack.",0
3639,"Not a single email until now? it's already twelve o'clock. I can't believe it! Can't bear it, right? I've been there before. I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages, like there is something missing. Yeah, that's right. If no one sends me text messages, I'll go crazy. Actually, this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload '.",0,Addiction? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? no way!,6
3640,"Yes, it is. Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day? Absolutely.

3642,"Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I’ m picking the film, because I don’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick. Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything. Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous, and it’ s so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back. I’ m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’ re always so negative.",0,I’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.,0
3643,"You see, that’ s what I’ m talking about, I can’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore. Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings. Well he’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories. Love stories? More like one-night-stands.",0,"Don’ t criticize Mario or else I’ ll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours, they’ re no saints.",0

3650,"This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour! I think it’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally. Don’ t you agree? Oh, I agree. We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress. Maybe we should try a thai massage too.",0,What’ s special about a thai massage?,0
3651,I just love your hair that way. Thanks. Where did you have it done? My sister did it. When did you get yours cut?,0,Just yesterday. I'm still getting used to it.,0

3665,What's that book you have under your arm? It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months. How in the world did you get a copy? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn. I checked it out of the rental library. It only costs five cents a day.,0,Is it really worth paying for?,0
3666,"Do you know anyone who’ s had plastic surgery? You mean like a breast enlargement? I don't think that's really necessary. That's not the way a woman should stay attractive. Why not? Why can't we go back to the way things were? Because... I don't know. But, Connie, you wouldn't do that, would you?",0,Darned right I would!,0
3667,I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them! Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday! I hate this part of school. Why did you put it off until the last minute?,0,I didn't mean to. Things just kept taking up all of my time.,0

3669,"I can't tell you. OK, I want you to be happy when we are together, and when you are sad, I would always stay with you.

3672,"Ok... I’ ll talk to you later. Bye Carrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down. I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’ s so hard to talk to him at times. Maybe it’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.",0,"Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.",5

3674,You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened? I had to look after my son at home. What's wrong with him? He has a fever.,0,Is he getting better now?,0
3675,"How are you doing, Christopher? To be honest, I'm really fed up with work at the moment. I need a break! Are you doing anything this weekend? I have to work on Saturday all day! I really hate my job!",1,Are you available on Sunday?,0
3676,"Yes, that's my only day off until Thursday. Ok, well, my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday.

It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city.",4,What should I bring with me?,4
3677,"We've got plenty of inflatables, but if you want to sit on a chair, you'll have to bring your own sunlounger. I can just use my beach towel. I love lazing around in the sun.

3678,Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。 Positive 。 You don't think you could be wrong? I'am absolutely sure I'm right.,0,I don't know. It looks a little wrong down.,0

3680,"I could easily give you some time tomorrow night. Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door? Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with? I'll come prepared.",4,Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.,4

3682,"Yes. That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school. They actually study after school? That's right.After their school day is over, they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there. Hmm. That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids. Don't they ever relax?",0,"Of course they do.You know, Eliza, before I went over there I thought the same thing. I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there, and taught them, I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education. More than American parents are. And that is good. American kids don't study enough.",0
3683,"Asian cultures value learning very much. I know that. So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it's a good thing.In America, too many parents don't pay attention. But aren't the kids tired out? I mean, they go to school all day, and then they go to school in the evening too. As an English teacher, I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible. I tried to have a good time with my classes. The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it, they learned more. So it was a good experience.",0,Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient?,0
3684,the dinner was really good. It knocked my socks off. that's very kind of you to say so. Let's try some after-dinner wines. great. Sweet wines are my favorite. They always make a great finish to a decisions meal. do you prefer brandy or ports.,4,"port, please.",4
3685,excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor. the port is exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right? yes. You always have a good nose for wines. next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.,4,"oh, what's that?",4
3686,"it's made from naturally frozen grapes. why not? It sounds great. oh, here's to your health. thanks. Cheers.",4,cheers.,4
3687,"Hey Mike. What are you doing tonight? Nothing planned. How about you? Work is kicking my ass. I'm so stressed. Let's go grab a drink. I'm always up for a drink. To tell you the truth, it's been quite stressful here too.",0,I say we get drunk tonight. I don't want to think about all this stuff.,0
3688,My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money. What's changed? My wife has been pregnant for 7 months. I see. I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy.,0,My wife will be going back to work soon.,0
3689,"We came too early. There're still three hours before the performance starts. I know. Sorry, I shouldn't have rushed you, but I just couldn't stay at home and wait. Never mind. What about taking a look around the theater? Why not? I'd love to do that.",4,Here we go. There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art. ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art. ),0
3690,"Wow. Look at this. So delicate and beautiful. Did ancient Chinese people really wear them? Not really. They are just opera costumes. Do you like the embroidery? I surely do. They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that. No, no, no. They are all handmade, girl. You know, the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework.",0,Unbelievable! I could never do that.,6
3691,"Very few can. That's why these clothes only appear in the museum. Listen! Some people are singing outside. Is it the opera? Oh, yes. I heard there was an opera fans club. They are probably practicing now. Wanna have a look? Yes, let's do it.",4,Follow me. Make sure not to interrupt them.,0
3692,"Anna, that outfit looks wonderful on you! The color goes with your trousers perfectly. Thanks, Carla. That's quite a compliment coming from you. You always dress so tastefully. Well, that dress certainly shows your good taste. It must have cost a lot. No, not much. I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off.",0,"Really? You're an amazing bargain hunter! Next time there's a sale, promise you'll let me tag along with you.",6
3693,"Well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip? It was fun, I tell you. Tell me about it, will you? Well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight!",4,Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures?,4
3694,"Sure, we wouldn't miss that for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour. You were lucky then. Yeah, we spent the whole morning under the tall trees. We had our picnic there, too. What did you do after that?",4,We went for a swim in the sea. That was the biggest part of the day. Just look at my nice tan!,4
3695,"Where can I buy textbooks? First, you need to have the list of books for your class. Do you have that? Yes, I have that. Well, when you have that, you can take it over to the bookstore. Can you find it?",0,"No, I don't know where the bookstore is.",0
3696,"Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money? Really? How can I do that? Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today? No, I can't make it today.",0,I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1,0
3697,"Hey Lydia, what are you reading? I’ m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling! What are you talking about? Let me see that... What are horoscopes? It’ s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign. You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’ m an Aries. When were you born?",0,January 5th.,0
3698,"Let’ s see... you’ re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life. Looks like we’ ll both have interesting summers! That’ s bogus. I don’ t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense. No, it’ s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’ re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?",0,A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. That sounds just like you!,0
3699,"Oh, my god. How can you stand living in such a messy dorm? Our place is spotlessly clean, compared with others. Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester? In fact, I just swept the floor three days ago.",0,I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system.,0
3700,"You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now? I'm sorry, It's all my fault. You are always like this. I've told you many times not to tell her. Sorry, I had no intention.",0,"It's too late to say sorry now.Oh, what am I going to do?",1
3701,"Are you alright, Ethan? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are. To be honest, Ava, I've just had a really bad day. What happened? First, I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work.",0,What did your boss say?,0
3702,"He told me that if I showed up late one more time, he'd fire me. He's so mean! That's horrible. Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work? That was my second time. The first time, I was in a car accident. Is your boss Chinese?",0,"No, he's from Australia. Before I met him, I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going. I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things.",0
3703,What are you going to do? I think I'm going to look for another job. I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss. That sounds like a sensible plan. Do you want me to help you with your job search? That's very generous of you. Thanks for the offer.,4,Don't mention it. That's what friends are for!,4
3704,"Hello, Dora, I haven't seen you for a long time. Where have you been? I didn’ t go anywhere. I stayed at home. What's up? You look unhappy. Nothing. I just feel very lonely in this city. I miss my family.",5,"Oh, I know. Sometimes I have the same feeling with you. But you'd better not be so emotional.",0
3705,"What book is that? I just bought a new atlas. I’ m looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That’ s a vast country. Canada, china, and the use are huge too. There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.",0,"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, but compared to many countries in other continents, it’ s not very l",0
3706,"Tonight is a party night! What drinks do you think we need? Well, not everyone wants to drink beer. Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice. Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day. I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks, Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone. What about wine? Just buy a cask of wine. Have you bought ice yet?",0,"No, once I fill the tub with beer, I'll get the ice. The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice. The cooler, the better.",0
3707,"Hi, John! I haven’ t seen you for ages. Hi! Yes, it’ s been a long time. I’ m really glad to see you. I’ m glad to see you, too. How’ Ve you been? Just fine. How is everything with you?",0,"Not bad. I finally bought a house. It’ s an old one, but built really solid. It is close to here. Do you want to come over for lunch?",0
3708,"I’ d like that, but I’ m flying home this afternoon, and I told my parents I’ d meet them at the airport for lunch. OK, next time you’ re here. That’ s a deal. I heard that you moved to Florida.",0,"Yes, I’ m in Titusville. The space shuttle is launched from near there. I’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches.",0
3709,Tell me more. The shuttle launches are beautiful. I saw one that took off at midnight. The whole sky got bright. Sounds great! I’ m pretty happy living there.,4,"I want to see Disney World, Sea World, Universal Studios, and Weeki-Watchee Springs.",0
3710,I’ Ve been to all of them. I’ m jealous. I’ Ve never been to Florida. The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting. Come down for a vacation sometime. I’ ll take you to Disney World. That sounds great! I’ ll take you up on that invitation.,4,"I hope you do. And keep in touch, OK?",0
3711,I sure will. Here’ s my business card. Send me an email once in a while. Count on it. And here’ s my card. Don’ t hesitate to call me anytime. Thank you. I’ d better get going. I don’ t want to be late for lunch. Mom would worry.,0,"Well, I’ m really glad we bumped into each other. Have a good trip.",4
3712,"I'll tell you something that's good about action movies. The special effects are great! But they are so silly! They're not art! That's just your personal prejudice. Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic? James Cameron, of course.",0,"Well, did you know he was also the director of The Terminator?",0
3713,Can I help you? Yes. I am interested in applying for graduate school in America. We have some catalogues from U. S. universities. You may check in the reference stacks over there. Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools?,0,"Well, generally in the U. S. each university has its own outstanding fields. But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th.",0
3714,"Can you be serious for a moment, we've been dating for 6 months now, I really like you. I'd like to take a relationship to the next level. So what are you trying to say to me? It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship. It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating. How should I say it?",0,I don't want to be like this. I think we should get step further.,0
3715,"It has only been 6 months, our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate. We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over. Like what? Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek. It was only the cheek.",0,"That is ok, then? Starts on the cheek? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car.",0
3716,"How did you get around over there? Did you rent cars? No, that would be too expensive. We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass. It lets people use the train wherever they want, as often as they want. I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot. Yes, they do. I wish we Americans had a better train system.",0,"I know. Our train system is lousy.And besides, Americans love their cars too much.",0
3717,"I agree. And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains. It's too bad for the environment. So much pollution from cars. Americans love cars for different reasons, I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people. Yes, I agree. I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what? Probably, in the future, Americans will have to change.",0,"Why do you say "" have to ""?",0
3718,"Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever. I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious, world governments will have to start limiting car use. Maybe you're right. They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America. Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important. Wow! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon. I have to get home. Do you want me to give you a ride?",0,"No, no problem. I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner.",0
3719,"It's raining outside, Catherine, it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown? It's very hot, the temperature is often over 40C. Do you like the weather in Seattle? Not really.But I like it in spring and fall. I don't like it in winter.",0,Why?,0
3720,"The winter is very rainy, I don't like the rainy day. What about the weather in Boston? I lived there for three years. I like summer but I don't like winter. Is it very cold in winter?",0,"Yes, it is.But it's nice in spring and fall.",0
3721,I want to say goodbye to everyone. You’ re leaving so soon. When are you off? I’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning. how about I come and see you off?,4,You really don’ t need to.,4
3722,"Ok. I’ ll miss you. I hope we can see each other again soon. I hope so, too. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for everything. You’ re welcome. Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me.",4,Ok. Take care. I hope you have a good journey.,4

3724,"What an attractive blouse, You look so pretty in this blue dress! Really? Thank you. I bought it in Spring Street yesterday. It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt. Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so.",4,Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste.,4
3725,What college are you attending? I am in Nanjing University. I am a junior. Why did you choose to attend that college? Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing.,0,What kind of college is it?,0
3726,"How do you like the play? It is very dull, and the production isn't very satisfactory, either. You're absolutely right. I think the acting could be better. To be fair, both the costumes and scenery are marvelous.",0,Maybe you're right. But I really don't like it.,0
3727,"What are you studying all day long for? It’ s summer vacation! I know! I hate it! But I’ m taking this crash course in math. Why? I have to take my exams for getting into the university, so I need to prepare.",0,Do you think it will help?,0
3728,"Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie? Oh, yes. You? Yes. What did you think of it? I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it?",0,"I liked it, too. It was scary, but not disgusting. I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. He's brilliant.",0
3729,"Hi charles, I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian. You did? that is great! Yeah, I am having a party this saturday night, a sort of house warming, and i want to invite you. are you busy? No i am free, i will be there, what time the thing starting?",4,Around seven.,4

3731,"Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night? No, but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend. Yes, that was surprising. I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go. They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood.",0,They're also one of the richest couples. They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want.,0
3732,"I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars. Did either one of them win an Oscar this year? I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films, but I don't think he won anything. Tom Cruise may be handsome, but I think he's a bit crazy, don't you?",0,"Yes, his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous.",0
3733,I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves. People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated. I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you. That's true. I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go.,0,Thank goodness we're not rich and famous!,4
3734,"Oh, my God! I've been cheated! What? What did you buy? It's a brick! I can't believe how stupid I was. Damn it! What is it? Why did you buy a brick?",0,"There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes, Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick.",0
3735,And? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars. A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks. And it's a brick? Yes.,0,I can't believe how stupid you are. Why didn't you open the box?,0
3736,"I wanted to. But he said, no, the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened, other people won't believe it's new. So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic. Yes, it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look, it even had a bar-code price sticker on it! It looked brand new. But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars?",0,He said he had to get rid of them. They were stolen.,0
3737,"What do you like to do in your spare time? I am a girl of many interests. I like dance, chess, collecting stamps, travelling and taking photos. What kind of dance do you like? I like rumba and tango.",0,Great. I am not interested in Chinese chess. It is too difficult for me.,4
3738,"You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess. Both of them are much easier. OK, I will try. As for stamp, don't you think it is an expensive hobby? Yes, it is. But it is full of fun and knowledge. What about you, what do you like to do as hobby? I like gardening. I take care of them everyday. I like those flowers and the swing in my garden. If the weather is nice, I would like to lie on the lawn.",4,Sounds pleasant.,4
3739,"I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly? Yes, it's one of the main air pollutants. Factories don't emit it directly into the air. It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight. Sorry? What does VOC stand for? Oh, Vous are ' volatile organic compounds '. That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint.",0,"So, what damage does ozone do to the environment?",0

3742,"What sports do you think women excel at most? I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in, like football. I mean which ones are they better at than men? Why do you care? Women and men are different all around. I don't think they can be compared.",0,That's a good point. Let me change my question. What sports do women like best?,0
3743,"I am going on my first date tonight. Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear? Well, I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear. That makes you very graceful and mysterious. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let me try it. Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace. Very attractive on formal occasions.",0,Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes?,0
3744,"How's your new car? Perfect! Couldn't be better. You made a good choice, then? It's just what I want.",4,No regrets.,4
3745,"Hey, let's eat out tonight. What's the occasion? You won the lottery? No. Just want to relax a little bit. You don't have to win the lottery to relax, do you? Well, I am kind of broke.",0,Come on. It's on me.,0
3746,"who is your favorite NBA star? Kobe Bryant, of course. Kobe? I know him, the key guy of the Lakers, a heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense. He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.",0,Maybe he is not good ay rebounding?,0
3747,"indeed, no man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit. Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA? who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him. well then, what are your spoils?",0,"well, nothing more than a jumble of photographs.",0
3748,"Can I help you? Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine? Yes, but it's checked out. What a pity! I missed it again.",5,It's popular you know. You want to reserve it?,0
3749,"Yes, please. Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book. Thank you. What shall I do when I check out these books? Take the card, and fill in your name and library card number.",0,Thank you so much.,4
3750,What do you like to do with your free time? Study English. You mean you like to study English? Why? It gives me great satisfaction.,0,Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work.,0
3751,"Mary? Are you still there? Yes. What do you want? Did your bid win? What do you care, dork?",0,"Hey! I'm trying to be nice, and you still want to fight! Did you get the statue or not?",0
3752,The final examination will be held at the end of this month. Have you made good preparation? Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year. Are you sure you can do well this year? I am 100 % certain.,4,"According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.",0

3755,I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. I haven't ever cared for that myself. Have you ever had garlic ice cream? That sounds absolutely disgusting!,2,"It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.",0
3756,"Hi Colin. How are you feeling today? Oh, I feel ok but I’ m still very tired. It's probably jet lag. I think so. One minute I feel quite awake, and the next I feel very tired.",0,Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city?,4
3757,"Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long It’ s a skill. What can I say? I don’ t know why, I just have a long routine. Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’ s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you’ re out the door. Half an hour, tops. Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’ t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’ s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ ll put my hair up, butoften times I bloody it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’ s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.",0,"True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?",0
3758,"How do you do. I’ m Mark Rancor. Nice to meet you. May I know your name, please? I’ m Rose Teller. I think I’ Ve seen you somewhere before?",0,"Ah, yes. I remember now.Were you Mr. John’ s dinner partner last month?",0

3760,"You like Titanic? That movie is so cheesy. It's not cheesy! It's romantic. When it first came out, I saw it in the theaters five times in one week. Really? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997, but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy. Alright, maybe it's a little bit cheesy. But come on, isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while?",0,"Actually, I have to admit that you're right. I like some pretty cheesy movies too. I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks, especially "" Terminator. """,0
3761,"I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car. Yes. I am very interested in the Olympic Games, and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics. Me, too. I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics. That's cool. Care for a little quiz on that?",4,No problem. I'm an ' Olympic expert '.,0
3762,"Wow, you've talked the talk. Now it's time to walk the walk. Here we go. First, can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics? The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece. Good. Why do people name it Olympics? They name it after the place where it was first held.",0,Who started the modern Olympics?,0
3763,This question is a piece of cake. A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin. What did people call him? Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics '. What did he do for restoring the Olympics?,0,He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics '.,0
3764,"I really should be on my way. Oh, don’ t go yet. Let’ s at least have one more. No, thank you. I can’ t. It’ s too bad that you have to leave so early.",0,Thank you very much. I had a really good time.,4

3766,"May, could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today? Sure, no problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester. I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class. I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class.",0,"Yeah, my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.",0
3767,"Fortunately her class is just an elective course, not as important as compulsory courses. Right, so we must spare some time to attend selective courses. But isn't it too impolite to be absent? What can I do? I have things to do in Students ' Government.",0,"Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note.",0
3768,"Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record. Yeah, besides, your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious. I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government. You can't write with one hand and draw with the other.",0,"I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government. But before that, I must do my job. Bye. Don't forget about that note.",0
3769,"Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing? How regular? An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey, the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that. You are kidding me? It is against the labor law. They should be aware of their rights.",6,But these people say nothing about that. They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days.,0
3770,"Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind '. Sorry, we have sold out the tickets. What's on tomorrow at that time? ' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again. And there's also ' Titanic '.",0,"Terrific, that's a wonderful movie, I like it very much. Can I get tickets now for tomorrow?",0
3771,"What would you like to be in the future? A teacher. But if I were you, I would be a singer. You've got such a beautiful voice. I wouldn't like to be a singer, but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing, That dream developed in my mind when I was a child.",0,Are you sure about that?,0
3772,"My goodness! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race. Excuse me, what did you say? A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games. That's incredible. I can't believe it.",6,You have to. It is sure.,4

I’ m not even from the United States. I’ m a spy for the Indian government.",0
3774,"What? Why didn’ t you tell me before? What are you doing here? When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau. What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, why did you lie to me! I’ m sorry, I wasn’ t supposed to meet you. I wasn’ t supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.",0,I can’ t believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can’ t take it anymore! Let me out of the car!,1

3776,"She is so beautiful and elegant. And she is famous for her fine acting. What's more, she doesn't have scandals. And she likes to take part in the charitable activities. Who is the director? Steven Spielberg. Another superstar.",4,"Yes, a legend, also. I still remember, his movies, Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994.",4
3777,"Oh you look awful! What’ s the matter? Oh! I feel really under the weather. I’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough. Oh dear. Maybe you’ Ve caught a cold.

You have got a great mother.",0,"I felt embarrased. After all, I am 18 years old. Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk.",0

3781,"Yeah, but I’ m not there for fun. I have to remain professional and if I get distracted, the manager would be pretty upset. That’ s true. I’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job? Of course. There’ s always much to learn. I got to know more about the real world. You mean you got working experience, right?",0,Not just working experience. I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life.,0
3782,"It must be very demanding. Sometimes it is. But after working for a few weeks, it’ s easy to figure out. Really? It sounds interesting. Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I’ ll show you around.",4,Great. I’ m looking forward to it.,4
3783,"Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time? What? Why do we have to do that? Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour. I see. That’ s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!",1,"That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich!",0
3784,"Does your girl friend like swimming? Yes, she does. She is good at backstroke and free style. Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke. But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke",0,Really? Then just ask her to follow me.,6

Have you received any other offers?",0
3788,"Mr. Lin, what are you interested in? I enjoy camping. Really? I'm not much of an outdoor person. What do you like about it? I love the fresh air, the scenery the exercise, and the time to think.",4,Do you hike or fish on your trips?,0
3789,"Yes, both. Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles. Did you catch anything? Yes, but I threw them back. How about Joining our summer camp next week?",4,Great! I can't wait.,4
3790,"Hey, Jim. I didn’ t know you biked to work. Yeah, it helps keep me fit and helps the environment, too. One less car on the road means less pollution. Right. Since my work is near a park, it’ s a really nice ride, too.",4,How far is it?,0
3791,"Oh, about 10 miles. It takes me about an hour. That doesn’ t sound too bad. I wish I could do it, but I work in the city. So I take the train. You’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation, too. True. Well, see you tomorrow.",0,See you.,0

3801,"Thanks for inviting me to your friend’ s wedding. I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony. Is that common? Well, some people use a standard set of words, but many couples today write their own wedding vows. Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting, but it didn't look like real rice to me. It wasn't. It was birdseed. We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it.",0,"Oh, I didn't think of that. Well, this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China. Plenty of food and drink, music and dancing, and interesting traditions.",4
3802,"Excuse me. Can you tell me how to find some books on social science? Sure. You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls? Yes. These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library. Together they constitute the library's "" card catalog "". You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another. Fox example, this drawer goes from SCA to SCM.",0,"So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society, I'd just look under ' A '.",0
3803,"No. You'd look under ' W '. The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization, and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ', ' introduction to ', ' story of ' and so forth. What if I don't know the title of the book? Well, you can look under the author's name. Could you give me an example?",0,"Suppose you want to find a book by your professor, William Smith. You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM. Since that's very common name, you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in.",0

3904,"I should start exercising more. It's hard work while exercising, but it is a great feeling when I get done. I have a running machine at home. I used to use it, but I already got sick of it. Exercising at home is hard. The environment is not suited for exercising.",0,"If I want to exercise, I will need to join a gym.",0
3905,I have a couple of guest passes. You want to check out my health club? That's a good idea. Let's go over the weekend. Great. I'll call you Saturday morning. Aright. I'll talk to you later.,4,Ok. Bye.,4
3906,Is there anything wrong? I’ m worried about my daughter. She can’ t decide about college. Don’ t worry. That’ s just a part of being a teenager. I don’ t mind that. But she disagrees with me about everything.,0,You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself. You shouldn’ t affect her decision.,0
3907,"Good evening. I've come to see Miss Morrison Oh! Good evening. I'm sorry, but she is not in. She's gone out to the theatre Oh! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents Please come in",0,"But you're busy, aren't you?",0

3909,"You didn't tell me she was married! I tried. You were preoccupied. I got carried away. I made such a fool of myself. They were both laughing at me! You got drunk, and you were hilarious. Lighten up.",0,That guy was definitely a Don.,0
3910,"Who is this on the water buffalo? That's my grand-father. He was a farmer. When he was young, he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field. Oh yes, that was the best job in most farm families. That's where many of them learned to play the flute. My grandfather did that too. He used the time to study instead.",0,That's interesting. Go on!,4
3911,"My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business. He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school. So he became a self-taught man? Right. Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village. When he was middle aged, he became a great man, quite famous. In what field?",0,As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country.,0
3912,"I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job. Why are you considering trying for it? I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it. What is it about this job that appeals to you?",0,I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.,0
3913,"Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider. I am also wondering about the pay. Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth? I am thinking that might be the case.",0,I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind.,0
3914,"Hello, Kevin. I hate to do this, but I have to cancel our appointment. Oh, no! Why? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place. Yeah, I really wanted to come, too.

Say, next Wednesday evening?",0
3915,"Look at this, A Brief Introduction of Hollywood. Hackneyed theme! What? How much do you know Hollywood? Nearly everything.",4,You are full of boasts. I can examine you by question and answer. What is Hollywood? Where is it? What is the function of it?,0
3916,"Too easy questions. Listen carefully. Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California. Many films have been made there, and the kinds have changed often. Not bad. What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s Gangster movies. Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it. Mm. What came after that?",4,"After all that violence, people needed to laugh, so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s, many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made. Then came musicals.",4
3917,"Pretty good. Please continue. Right. By the mid - 50 ' s, this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects. There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years, and that was the, mm, the... The western films about America's cowboys, Indians and early settlers. Come on.",4,"Since the early 1960 ' s, there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening, unnatural situations, and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened, and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds. Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have.",4
3918,"How good are you at sports, Bill? Are you kidding? I’ m terrible! But I love to watch sports. I go to football or baseball games a lot. And I read sports magazines every week. Wow! Do you like sports, Janice?",0,"Oh, yes. I like to exercise. But I don’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don’ t have much time to do those things.",0
3919,"Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising? Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband. I always feel good afterward. That’ s great! I’ Ve heard people say that before. Well, why don’ t you try to get some exercise? It’ s difficult, but very rewarding.",0,"Oh, I’ m too lazy to play sports, and I’ m not good at anything either. It hardly excites me.",0
3920,"Alice, your father is amazing. He’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house. I know. He doesn’ t like to ask anyone for help. My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself! That sounds like my Grandmother. She was always stubbornly independent. It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own.",0,They see their independence as a kind of character strength.,0
3921,"This little wooden stick is called a tee. What do you do with it? For the first drive, put the golf ball on the tee, and push the tee into the ground. Okay.",4,"Pick up a wood and hold it like this, interlocking your fingers.",4
3922,"OK. Position yourself, swinging the club, watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can. Hey! Not too bad. The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible.",4,Got it.,4

3925,"Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place? No, not usually. Most people are married in a church, and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception. Sometimes, however, they hold the reception in a big room in the church. Where do they go? Either they go to a public place such as a hotel, a restaurant, or a club, or to the home of the brid",0,They go to the home of the bride?,0
3926,"Why do you ask? The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite. Oh! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement, costs, etc. So the reception is held at her home. That's very expensive for the family of the bride.",0,Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding.,0
3927,"And the cover is great! The colors are brilliant! Give me a break. You don't care about the colors. You just like the hot babe on the cover. OK, you got me. So, do you have a subscription?

Is it casual?",4,"Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.",4
3931,"That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up. Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people. That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know? Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.",4,Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.,4

3933,"Sure. But I still liked it. Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself? No. Although motorcycle is nice, I’ d like to buy a bicycle. But why? Since you like it so much.",6,Because bicycles are safer.,0
3934,"How do I buy my textbooks? Do you have your book list for your class? Yes, I have my list. Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that is?",0,"Yes, I know where the bookstore is.",0
3935,"OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there? No, I didn't know I could do that. You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door. Do you think you will be going there today? Yes, I am going today.",0,"Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1",0
3936,"Is there anything wrong with your food this evening, Miss? Sorry to trouble you. But I don't think this fish is fresh. It actually tastes a bit off. Sorry, Miss. I'll place it immediately, can I get you another drink, or you wait? No, please don't do that. I'd just like to return it.",0,"I'm sorry, Miss, but I'm afraid we can't do that. You'll order something else instead. I'd love to suggest the steak, it's the special today, and quite tasty.",0
3937,"Bill. Bill! You gotta help me! What’ s wrong? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack. Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven’ t bought my mom anything! I’ m such a bad son! Take it easy! Let’ s go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like.",0,That’ s just it! I don’ t know what to get her!

3939,"Hey. Owen! Have you gone on your family vacation yet? Oh, yes. I got so tired. My son began to cry the moment we got on the train. It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep. Didn't you bring his favorite toy? Yes, we did. Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag, and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms.",0,Where did you go? You've got a beautiful tan.,0
3940,"My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks, so we compromised and finally went to the seaside. I think vacation in summer is not good. You must have had a great time. Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming. Yes, he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten. His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir.",0,"And I taught him how to swim in the sea. It was fun and made him braver than before. After we returned home, he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom.",0
3941,"This is going to surprise you, but I'm happy. I think you're making the right move. You do? Look, maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but I'v going over to WebTracker, too. No way! That's great! Then we'll still be together!",6,"Actually, I'm already working for WebTracker. Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth, so I figured, what the heck.",4
3942,"Life's so boring. Well, most of the time it is, I guess. What do you think will make you happy? I think money will make me happy.",0,You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.,0
3943,"It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do. You'll get bored eventually. Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, then I don't have to work. That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.",0,"You see... money doesn't equal happiness, but it takes away a lot of responsibilities.",0
3944,"Have you signed up to join the company’ s Christmas party? Sure, I have. Will you join? I will. You know, as a newcomer, I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere. You are right. Our company’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better. It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking.",0,I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there.,0
3945,"Hello, Susan, it’ s me, An. Hi, An. How are you? I am fine. I am going swimming this afternoon. Are you coming with me? I am afraid I can’ t this afternoon.

3946,"Do you have girlfriend? Yes, why? Well, I came to know a girl three weeks ago. We have so much in common. So?",0,So I think I may fall in love with her.,4
3947,"That sounds great. But how do you know that's a crush or a real love? Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love? That's a big question. Well, if you're in love, maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all. That's what I do.",4,And you think about her all the time?,4
3948,"Yes. And maybe you suddenly have new interests. I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid. For instance, you used to sleep in every morning, but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging. That's it. She likes dogs so much now, and I begin to love dogs. Oh, congratulations. Sounds like you've found your soul mate.",4,"Thanks, but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another.",4
3949,"What book is that? I just bought a new atlas. I’ m looking this map of the world. Look at Russia! That’ s a vast country. Canada, China, and the USA are huge too. There are several tiny countries in the world too. Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities.",0,"Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia. European countries are relatively small. France looks quite big in Europe, but compared to many countries in other continents, it’ s not very large at all.",0
3950,How about a movie tonight? It doesn’ t matter to me. Does 7 o'clock suit you? Either way. I don’ t care.,0,How about a snack after work?,0
3951,I couldn’ t careless. Would you rather stay home? Whatever you say. Are you really interested in doing something?,0,I don’ t mind if you want to.,0

3954,"April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements. That is a good suggestion. We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them. Yeah, that would let us know what would work best.",4,I'll put the survey online this afternoon.,4
3955,"You’ ll never guess what! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married! Wow that’ s great news! They’ re a great couple! I know! Anyways I just talked to Alex’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It’ s gonna be so much fun!

We are gonna play drinking games, get him some gag gifts and just have a good time. Nothing too over the top.",0

3957,We still have one more day to go before we return home. What will we see tomorrow? No idea. We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights. What else is there to see? What about a factory tour? You mean visit a factory?,0,Yes. I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend. We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry.,4
3958,"Good idea! I've always been interested in that. How much is the entrance fee? I'm not sure, but as far as I know, most factory tours are free. They are sponsored by the company providing the tour. Really? What do the companies do that for? I believe most of them think it as good public relations. They can promote their product and make their company better-known.",4,"Oh, ISEE. So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors.",4
3959,I just had a terrible week. what a shame! I fell down and hurt my arm. That's too bad.,0,Then my son drove into a tree.,0

Uh, to begin with, please take a look at the syllabus in front of you. As you all should know by now, this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50. That's terrible. He speaks too fast. How can I catch his meaning?",0,"Again, as you see on your course outline, grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test, periodic quizzes, and classroom participation.",0

By the way, did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently?",0
3967,"Really? I thought his parents had died several years ago. They did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government. Dying can be very expensive nowadays! What’ s he going to do with it? He said that he would probably invest most of it. He’ s got a well-paid job, so he doesn’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.",0,I had some good financial news yesterday too.,0
3968,"Julia, I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning. I know them. They are the two brothers living next door. Brothers? Do you know why they quarreled?

3969,"I think I'm going to go home. Why? We just got here. I know, but it's 12 12",0,Three or four o'clock?,0
3970,"Yes. I never stay out that late. That's too late. But why is it too late? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow. Why not stay out and drink with us?

3972,"Don't worry about it. It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested, and they have a little pot in their possession, they don't go to jail. They just have to pay a fine. Really? Yes. I didn't know you had such wild friends. Do you smoke marijuana too?",0,"I tried it a couple times. But I don't like it. I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them, though. If you don't want to smoke pot, you don't have to.",0
3973,"I don't want to. That's alright. But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon. I don't know if I can drink more. I already had two drinks.

3975,"She came over last weekend. She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out. I tried to smile and be polite, but the whole time all I could think was "" what's wrong with your voice? "" Well, I guess it might take some time to get used to. I doubt it.

I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off.",0
3976,"Hey. Why did you take that money? You are such a cheater! I should send you to jail! I am not cheating. When you pass go, you collect $ 200, Everyone knows that! Well you can’ t just take the money. You have to ask the bank for money. And I’ m the banker. Banker?",0,Yes...,0

3979,"There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester. Yeah, so what do you think about the teachers? To be honest, I like all of them, except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seems like an old person. He's so boring. I think so too. I don't like him either. Well, who do you like best?",0,It might be the English teacher. What about you?,0
3980,"Me, too. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her. She is a pretty good teacher! With her help I think I can make great progress in English. Yeah, I like her way of teaching. She told us not to cram for exams, and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing. I think it's a good way to develop our language ability.",4,"Actually, our new math teacher is a good person. He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us.",4

When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.",0
3984,"What about all these other pieces? See this one that looks like a tower? It’ s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’ s a very important piece so it’ s best to not let your opponent capture it. And these two? They are husband and wife? That’ s right! That’ s the queen and that’ s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say Check Mate and the game is over! Doesn’ t this sound fun?",0,Nah! This is boring! I’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!,0

I’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly.",0
3987,"Oh dear. What a pity. Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre? Yes, quite sure. I think you should put an advertisement in china daily. Things where you lasted.

We’ d better have breakfast now. and meet him later.",0
3988,"Well, it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies. Maybe we're just different kinds of people. Yeah it's too bad... but actually I think I know what to do. What's that?

3989,"Jared, I just heard about your father. How is he doing? He's in the hospital resting. The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet. I'm so sorry to hear that. But this is a good hospital.

I don’ t mind coming out here for a while, but that will get old pretty soon. That’ s what I was thinking.

4007,"there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays. You should come along next week with me. I'd love to, but I have a night class on Thursdays. that's too bad. Maybe another time. let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends.

Yes, I am, but I think it’ s time for some plastic surgery I’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin. See?",0,"I don’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin! You are stop beings ridiculous. Besides, I think that people who get Boto, have facelifts, or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn’ t look natural.",0
4014,"Whatever, I think I’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well. I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing. I thought you were my friend and would support me on this! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive. You don’ t need plastic surgery to do that. You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you! Plus, plastic surgery hurts!",0,Really?,4
4015,"So how much should I gamble? Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars? Okay. One-hundred then. Do you think I will lose it? I don't know. You have to be smart, but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck. With some, you need to be smart.",0,I want games that are all luck.,0

Blackjack.We can play blackjack. And I will gamble one-hundred, or maybe two-hundred dollars.",0,Huh? You are breaking our rule already! And we didn't even start to play yet!,6

Do you like sports, Janice?",0,"Oh, yes. I like to exercise. But I don’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines. I don’ t have much time to do those things.",0
4018,"Oh, I see. You know, we spend time doing different sports. How much time do you spend exercising? Well, I guess I exercise about two hours a day. I do aerobics three times a week, and the other days I play badminton with my husband. I always feel good afterward. That’ s great! I’ Ve heard people say that before. Well, why don’ t you try to get some exercise? It’ s difficult, but very rewarding.",0,"Oh, I’ m too lazy to play sports, and I’ m not good at anything either. It hardly excites me.",0
4019,What can I do for you? I would like to use the copy machine. The machine is over there. Do I have to pay to use the machine?,0,"Yes, you will have to pay to use it.",0

4023,"Excuse me. Do you study Chinese at the university here? Yes, I do. But my characters are very bad. It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing. Are you Chinese?",0,"Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.",0
4024,How do you like it? I like it so far. But my English still needs work. I want to study Mandarin and international relations. Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?,0,They teach regular characters.,0
4025,"I see. I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified. You just said your English needs work, yes? Yes, that's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes. Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.",0,You mean you and I?,0
4026,"Yes, why not? I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English. That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it? Let's see... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange. How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?",0,"First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want, I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.",0
4027,"Would I help you with writing? No. For me right now, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook, and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes. I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet? Well, today is Monday.Actually, for me Monday at this time would be the best. I am free from now until 11",0,"Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1",0
4028,So if you want to meet at 10 It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on. And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder. I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own. Let me give you my phone number.,0,Sure. I'll give you mine too. Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason.,0
4029,"could we possibly discuss my salary some time? sure. first of all, I want you to know that I really like working for this company. Do you think I'm doing a good job here? well, you are a very hard-worker.",0,"I try very hard. The problem is, my salary just isn't enough to live on. Now that I have a wife and a child to support, we hardly have enough money for food and rent.",0
4030,"there are trying times for everyone. What do you propose? I could really use a 5 % rise. that's quite a bit. If I give you a raise, I'm going to have to give everyone a raise. listen, if you give me a raise, I'll take on extra responsibilities.",0,"that sounds reasonable. How about this, from now on, you can be responsible for scheduling. That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift, then you'll have to do it.",0
4031,"David, I’ m going to China. Really? How do you get the chance? You know. I took part in the Chinese contest. I was the best and they gave me this reward. I don’ t have to pay for my trip. Congratulations. How lucky you are!",4,Thank you. I’ m leaving tomorrow morning.,4

4035,"Maybe you won't believe this, but it was made by my grandmother. Really? It looks so nice. Thank you, Please have a cup of tea. All right.",4,How about some fish?,4
4036,"Graham, why are you always on the phone with Jane? Because we are partners in our science lab. Why are you so jealous? The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek. How do you explain that? My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek.",0,Are you sure?,0
4037,"Of course I am. I only love you, Amy. Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you. Why do you always accuse me like that? Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all.",4,"Oh, Amy. I am the luckiest guy in the world.",4
4038,What are you doing this weekend? Nothing much. I’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that’ s all I have planned. So you’ re free on Saturday night? That’ s right.,4,Would you like to have dinner with me?,4

Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline. I've gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me today. Aw, come on, it was nothing. I'm just doing my job. No, I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.",0,"Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint.",0
4040,"What are you listening now, Fred? What? Hey! Man, put your earphone out. I said which song you are listening to. Jay Chou's title song in his new album.",4,What's your comment on his new album?,4
4041,"Are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus? Yeah. Look, other kids are coming this way. But it doesn't look like a real bus stop. That's because regular buses don't stop here.",0,How much is it going to cost?,0
4042,"Excuse me, are you American? No. Do you speak English? A little, but not very well.",0,How long have you been here?,0
4043,"Excuse me, I bought this sweater yesterday. But when I got home and tried it on, I found it’ s too small. Do you have the receipt with you? Yes, here you are. Thank you. Do you want your money back?",0,"No, can I exchange it for a bigger one?",0
4044,"Did you enjoy that new movie? That movie's just a lot of noise, same as Simon. Oh, what happened, Carole? I had to go by myself, he couldn't make it.",0,"What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, he said he was coming.",6
4045,"Kitty's? He sure gets around, doesn't he? Looks like it. So how did he handle it to? His excuse was familiar. He said his car died again. I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.",0,I know. Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy.,0

I like totally drew a blank on everything!",0,"Well, now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it... what's-her-face... the one who always kisses up to the teacher.",0
4048,"Jennifer Davies? Give me a break! I can't stand her. She's such a dweeb! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time? She's the teacher's pet, that's why. Besides, he's so laid back he lets her get away with it. She just really rubs me the wrong way. And you know what? I think she's got the hots for him, too. Get out of here! I'm dead serious. Yesterday, before class starts, she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes, ‘ Good morning, Jim.’",0,"Oh, gag me! She's totally gross!",1
4049,"You are quite busy every day. Yes. Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six. So you have to work all day. I can take a break at lunch time, but it is only 30 minutes.",0,"I see you sometimes work on weekends, too.",0
4050,"Hi Mary, how's it going? well, last night I had a big argument with Ann. terrible. It must be something serious. You two are such close friends. now that I look back at it, it wawsn't that big a deal. I shouldn't have lost my temper.",5,really? What happened?,0
4051,"it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while, and we decided we could both make it this weekend. Then out of nowhere she called me up, said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee that's pretty harsh. I know, but I was so upset. I mean, come on! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says? you know she probably feels just as bad.",0,"well, I think I was being a little selfish myself. I know they don't get to see each other very often.",5
4052,"OK, Devon, I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy. Well, thank you. What do you recommend? What can I do to lose weight? Well, I exercise a lot. I go running at least three times a week. But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained.",0,"Yeah, well, actually, one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot.",0
4053,"I hear you are moving to Dalian. Yes. I found a very good job down here. Well, we'll certainly miss you here. I am going to miss you, too.",4,Let's keep in touch.,4
4054,"Nice weather, honey! The days are getting longer! May and Daniel often like this kind of weather. Yeah, they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot.",4,"Honey, how about taking them to the beach this weekend?",4

4057,"The small one, just down the street. I like their generic brand. I have been using the store across town for years. I hear they have very nice stuff. They do, but they're a little expensive on certain items.",0,"Well, you should try my store. The prices are good.",4
4058,"What upsets you? My parents called. As usual, they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done. Who should I marry? I have no time to go on a date. It is not your mother finding one for you? I will find one myself, of course. I’ m a modern girl.",0,"Perhaps you can try the three minutes date, the latest type.",0
4059,"You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol, I hate that idea. No, there is an updated version, three minutes video date. I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam, you can sigh for it. You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes. I don’ t think it makes sense. Three minutes is such a short time. I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone, so-called love at first sight.",0,"Anyway, I don’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that.",0
4060,"Hi, dear, I've got your voice at last. Hi, darling, I am thinking it is the time of your calling. Are you OK today? Quite good except thinking of you so much.",4,So do I. You are a beautiful flower in my mind.,4
4061,"Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night? Yes, I did. It is a horrible movie. I wonder why TV programs often show much violence.

4065,"It's almost Christmas. What are you doing this weekend? Nothing special, just working. Why do you ask? Well, I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping. Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend? I'd like to, but I'm not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don't we go on Friday instead?",0,Friday's not good.

4068,"This is tough to say, John, but I think we should break up. Are you serious? Yes, I mean it. But why? Did I do anything wrong?",6,"No, we are just too different. This relationship isn't going anywhere.",0
4069,"Hey, come on. It's too early to say that. We can fix things. I have thought about it for a long time. I think it's time to move on for both of us. But I still love you. I'm sorry.",0,I knew this would happen some day...,5
4070,"Then why didn't you talk to me? Well. It's not all my fault, Anna... I don't want to argue with you anymore. This is going to be tough, but let's try to forget that and be friends. Have you made the decision yet?",5,I think we'll be better off if we are apart.,0
4071,"Hi, charlie, are you busy this evening? Sorry, I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight. What are you doing? I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday.",0,How old is he today?,0

4077,"That's right. What do you think we should do as a hobby? That all depends on what you like to do. For example, I like to doodle on the notepad, so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings. I like to play the piano for fun. Yeah. That can be a good hobby.",4,Hobbies are great. I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do.,4
4078,"Jack, what's wrong? You! What are you talking about? What did I do? You told Martha that I was on a date? What was that all about?",1,No... that's not what I meant. I didn't mean that. She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara. I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends.,0
4079,"She started feeling suspicious after you said that. I'm sorry man. I didn't know. I didn't mean to screw anything up. Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend. Now, I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you. Look.

4083,"Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening? I park in the evenings. Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs? Yes, I have seen those signs.",0,The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors?,0
4084,"There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms. What are those? They are the things that make up the atom, such as electrons and protons. Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons?",0,Of course there is. Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can.,0

4087,"Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor. Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank? Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens. The engine won’ t start. Should I maybe press the accelerator? No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.",0,So what do you think it is?,0
4088,"Do you have a copy of today’ s newspaper? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship. Yes, I ‘ m just reading them myself. It’ s been a great competition.

Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump, but it only got him third place. Did you see the final of the men’ s 100 metres? It was very exciting.

4098,"There are so many environment problems in the world today. Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world? I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action, but I doubt it’ ll happen before it’ s too late. We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere. There’ s lots of clean, modern technology, but companies in developed countries say it’ s expensive.

I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here. you are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk. There's a grocery store, a book store, a gym, and many restaurants there's a gym nearby? That's exciting! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible. I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight.",4,"well, if you want we can go together sometime.

4101,"I am totally fed up with my boss. He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments. This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment. What happened? Did your boss say something to offend you at work? He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment. Don’ t you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn’ t be so bad...",0,"You’ re missing the point. It’ s about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It’ s his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words.",2
4102,"Is your lady beautiful? Since I came here from the country, I've not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?

4103,"It's going to strike 12 o'clock. Let's get the firecrackers ready, Rose. Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city? Well yes, but they are not allowed only in downtown areas. It's OK here. It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition. The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken. Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there. Fantastic! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds!",4,What other activities will you have tomorrow?,0
4104,"Quite a lot. The celebration of the New Year has just started. The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast, and people in the North have Jiaozi. Afterward, we will make New Year calls on family relatives, husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second. Do you bring some gifts along? That's for sure. Fruit, cream cakes, medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives, and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids. All this, of course, should be well prepared beforehand. Is it the same practice for all families?",0,"Not all the same nowadays I must say. Many families, especially those of newly married couples, choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines.

You know, I’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg. I don’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’ t know if you’ re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’ s just too much instability. I wouldn’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate.",0,"But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example, they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.",0

I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses! hints are really important when you're solving puzzles. If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game, I’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube.",0,it's a deal.,0
4110,"do you remember, years ago, when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos? yeah. That was a strange party. Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks? I don't know.

I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip. Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip?

4115,You ought to. One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time. A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network. I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers. That's the whole point. All your inhibitions disappear because you can’ t see the other person. This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn’ t talk to. I just want a private conversation with one other person.,0,"You can do that. A private session lets two people talk alone. This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody, without prejudice because you can’ t see them.",0

4119,"You know, I really don’ t think Americans are very romantic. Where did you get that idea? That’ s the impression I get from the movies, and from looking around. Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other. Well, I’ m still not sure what you’ re asking me.",0,Is it true or isn’ t it?,0
4120,"Do you want to know something about the American character? I just think you’ re trying to change the subject. But go ahead. No, this will help answer your question. In American society boys and girls are raised together. They’ re not segregated in their activities! Boys and girls go out together from an early age. OK, go on.",0,"After being raised together, men and women can be business-like in each other’ s company. It really doesn’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love. Does that answer your question?",0

Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don't know how I got a decent grade. That's probably because he grades on a curve.",0,Are you enjoying the class so far?,0

4125,"Some resolutions? That's a wonderful idea, but I have no idea yet. How about you? I want to be healthier this year, so I think I should take more exercise. That will be a good one! Anything else? Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry, which is a mess!",4,Sounds great!,4
4126,"It's weekend again, I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters. What do you mean by that? Oh, that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions. You've been always active and versatile. It seems that you are interested in everything.",0,"Oh, really? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert, painting, handwriting, reading novels and reading fashion magazines. What about yours?",0
4127,"I have fewer hobbies than yours. That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting. Oh, you can't think like that. We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas. You like taking photos and going to photography shows, why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable? That's a good suggestion. It's fine today. Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset. It must be fantastic. I quite agree with you. With our hobbies, our life can be more colorful and exciting.",4,And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend.,4

I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway... now that I'm going to have to make some claims, I think I'd better try and understand how the system works. Would you mind breaking it down for me? Sure. Basically we have two insurance policies for employees... workman's compensation and medical insurance. The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation, and for a significant part of the medical coverage, but you pay part of that premium, too. That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month, right?",0,"Yep. Every country in the world has a different system, but here we buy insurance from a private provider.",0

I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.",0,"I have told him how to do it several times, but he's never listened to me.",1
4143,"Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss. Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff. Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do, make sure you don't lose your temper. I think that's a bad idea. I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want?",0,I disagree. All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions.,0

I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English, and uses it as a basis for communicating. From start to finish he’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar. This is a very difficult way to learn. What do natives get?",0,"They get higher level English, which is more formal than everyday spoken English. They also deal with matters of style and creativity.",0

The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and japan – so beginning again",0,Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?,0

4180,"A little, but the rush was worth it. Tell me about it. We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us. 500 feet! I would never be able to do that.",6,"Yeah, it was scary, but exhilarating.",4
4181,How’ s the food? It’ s pretty good. Well I don’ t think so. I don’ t like it at all! I’ m afraid you’ re being too particular about your food.,0,I eat dog food when my parents are out.,0

4192,"You ' re scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia. I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad. Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak. Well, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic.

Oh, no.",6,"Yes, and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it? - and his radio didn't work. So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi.",0
4198,"So what did you do? Well, I actually thumbed a lift. You what? Yes, I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out, and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport.",0,"Wow, good for you.",6
4199,"Yes, except he drove really slowly, and I missed my flight. Oh, no! Yes, so I had to wait three hours for the next one. I didn't get home till four in the morning, and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok. You really have bad luck, don't you?",4,Seems like it.,4

No way, I am watching that, but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires. It doesn ' t make sense.",0,"Of course it does. It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different. And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.",0
4210,"What kind of person do you consider yourself to be? I think I'm polite, careful, relaxed and shy. Oh, I don't think you're shy! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party. Well. Yes, but those people always start talking to me. I never talk to them first. Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think. Anyway, you're certainly not shy!",0,You're right. I love going out and making new friends.,4
4211,"Can you speak Japanese? Yes, I can, but not very well. Where did you learn it? At school. And I'm still learning it now.",0,How long have you been learning it?,0
4212,"May, we are fools to hang out at noon. It's dying hot today. My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun. Do you have any sunscreen lotion? You know, honey, I used it all on the way over. I think I'm getting a heart stroke.",0,The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat.,2
4213,"Why? It's brand new, and it's perfect on you. But I bought it to get rid of the heat. Now it does nothing but burning my head. Beauty costs, honey. Laugh all you want, whatever. We need to get out of the heat.",0,Walking under the sun is certainly not the way.,0
4214,"Do you know much about computers? Not a great deal. I've just been reading an article about them. They'll be used for all sorts of things now. For accounting system and things like that, you mean?",0,"Yes, but they are used for other things, too. Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris.",0
4215,It’ s time for me to go now. Would you like me to go with you? I’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things. Do you want to type that letter?,0,I’ d rather you typed it.,0

If you absolutely refuse to take her out...,0
4219,It smells like an ashtray in here! Hi honey! What’ s wrong? Why do you have that look on your face? What’ s wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking. No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!,0,"Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It’ s not like you can just light up like before.",1
4220,"What's wrong, Dave? You look down today. I didn't pass the English exam. How to learn English well? Can you give me some suggestions? Well, English is a "" paper tiger "". Its natural enemy is adequate practice. I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises, and I also spend much time in memorizing English words.",5,"I suggest you read English texts aloud every day, and try to speak more. That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language.",0
4221,"I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to find a job. If I don't, I won't be able to stay here next semester. Have you tried university part-time jobs? What do you mean? I mean in the library, or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions.",0,"Yes, I know. I tried that.They don't have anything now. So what can I do?",0
4222,"Well, since you're a foreign student, it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America. I know that. You don't have to tell me that. That's my problem. I know I have the right to work for the university. That's legal.But they don't have a job for me. And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere. Anyway, there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York. But I need a pretty decent job. I need to make enough to pay my rent at least.",0,I have an idea.,0
4223,"What? Since you're Chinese, maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown. I already had that idea. Well, why don't you go and look down there?",0,But I don't know what I would do.,0
4224,"Excuse me, Professor, is there a time when I could meet with you? I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best? I would like to come in at three o'clock. I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office?",0,"Yes, I can.",0

4228,"Are you okay, man? You don’ t look very well. Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor, and things got a little out of hand. Nice! So, where did you guys go? We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!",0,Oh no! Mike’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure!,0
4229,Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar! Is that why you missed work today? Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times.

4230,"Hey Claire, you've been really quiet these last few days. Is something wrong? I've been really stressed. It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do! I feel like I'm drowning in work. Well, stress is a real thing. It's not an imaginary condition. It's seriously affecting my life! I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay... why am I so weak?",0,"You're not weak... you're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators... and as you might imagine, that was pretty stressful.",0
4231,"Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork! But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors! It's called the flight or fight response. Each time you feel like something's threatening you, your body decides whether to run away or fight... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body. So a deadline will cause that same reaction? It could. Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did. They just had a couple of close calls every day, but today, we have dozens or even hundreds!",0,So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life?,0
4232,"Hey, Mary, what's up? Not much. Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight. Oh, that's exciting. What's this guy like? Is he hot? Well, I ddin't think so at first. But as we started talking, I found him extremely funny and witty. I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes! We have so much in common. We like the same teams, music, and most amazingly, we both love Chinese food! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends.",4,It seems you two are a good match. What qualities do you look for in a friend?,4
4233,"When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill, what do you do to attract his attention? I just make eye contact with him and nod my head. Then I tell him when he comes over to the table. Why do you ask? I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill. That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant.",0,"That’ s what I thought. I just thought I’ d ask you and see what you thought of it. Anyway, what did you do yesterday evening?",0
4234,"Well, it was a warm evening, so I stretched my legs. I walked along the canal for a couple of miles. Actually, several other people had the same idea. I saw Bill. Did you? How is he these days? He seemed ok. We didn’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal. We just waved at each other. I need to move some furniture. Could you help me to lift it?",0,Of course. What do you want to move first?,4
4235,"Excuse me, Miss. Yes. May I help you? I'm a graduate student here in mathematics. I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before. I'll be here for five years, so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible. I wonder if someone might have time to show me around. I'd be very glad to show you around, but I'm very busy right now. Could you come back about 3 thirty?",0,Sure. 3 thirty this afternoon.,0
4236,"Don't open any of my forwards! I got a virus! Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus. I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world. Yes, that's exactly the bug I got. Though, I do kind of like the pictures. Those clothes do suit him better.",0,Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted?,0
4237,"I need some flowers for my girlfriend. No problem. Would you like some artificial carnations? Oh, no. Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion. How much did you want to spend?",0,Money is no object.,0
4238,Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily. I will take ten. Do you want to add some baby’ s breath for that? They are equally popular now. Of course. Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon?,0,"Yes, but there is a five dollars delivery charge.",0
4239,"Julie, what's on the tube? nothing but bench of commercials. These days the amount of commercials is amazing. yeah. Maybe we can change to another channel. what about the sports channel? Let's see if there's a game on. okay. Nope, it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain.",0,"it was a good game, but not good enough to watch again. Keep surfing.",0
4240,"alright. Hmm, this movie is a rerun... I don't know how many times I've seen this show... Commercial again... and a replay of the talk show... oh no, this show is terrible, you don't wanna watch it. oh, what is it? it's a total rip-off of an American reality show, but the imitation is unbearably clumsy. oh, I know this kind of shows. Sometimes they really piss me off. If I wanted reality, I'd go outside.",0,"yeah... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats, or commercials, or low-quality shows. There's really nothing to watch.",0
4241,"Did you go to the bank to withdraw money? Today is so hot, besides I had so much housework to do. My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours. I didn’ t forget, but I had no time at all. So you didn’ t. Is that right? Yes. I’ m sorry.",0,Why didn’ t you just answer my question directly? Why would Chinese answer questions this way? I simply asked if you did it or not. It’ s a very simple question. And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer.,1
4242,"Did you tip the bellboy? Yes, but I don’ t think it was enough. He looked disappointed. I gave him three dollars. That sounds about right to me, fifty cents a bag. If they think you don’ t know better, they’ ll try to get more. It’ s the same in Balloon. But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver. The fare was twenty dollars, and you gave him a five-dollar tip. That’ s twenty-five percent of the total! Too much!",6,"I disagree. He was polite and informative, and he drove smoothly. One should reward good service.",0
4243,"Mom, what are you doing? I'm clipping coupons. Still clipping coupons? It's a good way to save money.",0,Saving money? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons?,0
4244,"Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say? Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery?

4247,"Hi Joe. You met my new assistant, right? Emm... yes. But I wasn't too impressed. I found her a little stuck up. You are kidding, but she's so helpful. Tom... you are her boss, you down. Of course, she's helpful to you.",0,Come on. She's like that with everyone.,0

4250,"That's right, Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters. What are step-sisters? Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter. When she was young, Bill's first wife, Sarah's mom died. Three years later Bill married again. So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother. Right?",0,Yes. She is Sarah's step-mother.,0
4251,"I'll help you, Lucy. Look at what I've got here. In this small bottle, there's a magic love potion. A magic love potion? Yes.

4252,"All right, let's see who's ruining my TV time. What are you going to do? Call my boss and chew him out? Is your boss named Vic? Your pager says, This is Vic. Here I come! Impossible. My pager is really old. It doesn't display messages.",0,"Here, see for yourself. That's really strange! It's almost the same as when I...",0
4253,"Don't talk too much, Tom. We are on duty today, we should hurry up. OK. Tom, your task is to clean the blackboard. How about yourself?",0,I'm going to sweep the floor first.,0

And at night we walked around the city with some friends.",4,Did you take any pictures?,4
4256,"Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them? Sure, I love looking at photos. This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife. Your daughter looks like her mother.",4,"I know, they look very similar.",4

4258,"Are you interested in history? Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks. I love history, but I’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened. I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks!",0,Some people say that history repeats itself.,0
4259,"Nice day today, isn't it? Yes, beautiful weather we're having. We can't complain about the weather recently. Yes, the sun shines day after day. It's neither too hot nor too cold.",4,I wonder how long this weather can last.,4

4263,I just got a letter from an old high school buddy. Really? That's nice. He usually keeps me posted. I've been completely out of touch with my old friends.,0,It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much.,0
4264,"What did you think of the film? I liked it. I thought it was great. Yes, I liked it, too. Did you like the acting? Yes. I thought it was excellent. Didn't you?",4,Not really. I thought it was disappointing.,2
4265,"Do you know something about Mount Tai? Yes. But not too much. It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China. Five sacred mountains? Why people call them so? Because in history, the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation.",0,Got it. Can we see any things left by them?,0
4266,"Mary, this is your homeroom. It's 213. Remember that. What's a homeroom? You sit in there, listen to the morning announcement with other kids, and then you go to your classes. Cindy, I'm scared.",3,But I have to go to my homeroom.,0
4267,"Helen, you must be excited at going to America to study. Yeah, I've been looking forward to it for ages. What do your classmates think of it? They give me a lot of congratulations.",4,How long will you study there.,0
4268,"Oh, maybe three years. I will study and get the master degree first. Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back. Which university will you go to? Chicago University. My major is Economics. Good luck!",4,Thank you!,4
4269,"Look! Someone is celebrating his birthday. This must be his 21st birthday. No doubt about it. Why? Do you know that guy? No. Well, in America, 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink. So, many guys celebrate it in bars.",0,"That's interesting. But it would be really expensive, I suppose. Just think about all the drinks.",0
4270,"have you adapted to the lifestyle in China? yeah, almost. But there is one thing. what? I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people. I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China, but...",0,what is it?,0
4271,some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others. that makes you feel uncomfortable? yeah. we never do that in a public office. perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy.,0,"i have felt that. One day when i was in a queue, reading a newspaper story, the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding.",0
4272,"Excuse me, Miss. Yes. May I help you? I'm a graduate student here in mathematics. I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before.

4273,"what's your apartment like? it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus. what is it like living in on-campus housing? it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The freshmen that live nearby are really loud, especially on the weekends. But, the rent is much cheaper than private housing, so it's worth it.",0,did you have to pay a deposit?,0
4274,"no, but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months, so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month. do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent? no, it's all included. Besides, students don't have to pay council tax, so we're saving quite bit of money by living here. how long is your contract for?",0,"that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June, so we'll have to find a new apartment soon.",0
4275,"You should have seen the T. V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting, animal rights. Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights. Yes, but we can’ t deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings. I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren’ t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.",0,"You can’ t compare apples and oranges. I believe that both topics are important and that we can’ t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.",0
4276,"Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear. Yeah... hearts, stars and some weird looking things. Those are money bags, and they represent your financial situation. So decode this for me, Madame Psycho.",0,That's Madame Psychic to you.,0

4279,"What should I take first? That chair over there, but please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law. Don't worry, I won't drop it. Wow, it's really heavy. I don't think I can move it by myself. Let me help you with that. I don't want you to hurt your back.",0,Where are you taking all this stuff?,0

4283,"I see! Do you want to ask her out? sure, but how? you can ask her out for drink after work. but for what reasons? She doesn't even know who I am.",0,then you've got a lot of homework to do. You need to get her notice first.,0
4284,easier said than done. you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her. but I always get tongue-tied when I see her. that's something you need to overcome. Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased.,0,I see. I'll try.,0
4285,"Lisa, would you like to go to the library with me? OK. Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first? Sure. First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library. Are we going to walk or drive?",4,The weather is really nice today. Let's walk.,4

4287,"Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you, what are your tricks? Thank you for saying so. I don’ t know, probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues. Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work. That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.",0,You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.,4
4288,"how was your education going on in Australia? I'm going to graduate this summer. where are you going to work then, in Australia or back in China? I'm planning to return to China after graduation.",0,why are you choosing to leave a foreign country? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad.,0
4289,"well, I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment. yeah, China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country. absolutely, many Chinese enterprises are going global, and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business. the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home.",0,that's right. Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China.,0
4290,"How do you like this dress? It's nice. But what kind of dress are you looking for? Something attractive and dressy. Maybe a little sexy too. New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year, right? Of course. It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year.",0,People here always wear the best clothes they have. Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve.,0
4291,"Any other common customs of your New Year? Before the New Year, we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year. On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year '. It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution. What's that? It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do. Many people resolve to quit smoking, lose weight, or stop nagging their wife, etc. However, it usually lasts only for a few days!",0,"By the way, where are you going on New Year's Eve?",0

4296,"To be honest, I liked all of them, except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seem like an old person. He’ s so boring! That’ s too bad. How was your English teacher? She was great. In today’ s class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to arm for exams, and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing. Where is she from?",0,She said that she’ s from a small town in the middle of America.,0
4297,"Were you able to understand everything that she said? Not everything, but nearly. She speaks very clearly and doesn’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her. She sounds like a good teacher. Do you think you’ ll pass her class? Yes... with flying colors!",4,What does that mean?,0
4298,"It’ s a new phrase that she taught us today. It means that I will not only pass the class, but I will do extremely well! If you like the class this much already, I’ m sure you will. I hope so. did she give you any homework?",0,"not today. She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework,",4

4300,The police need our help finding a robber. How do you know? The TV news is reporting a bank robbery. Do they know what the robber looks like?,0,"Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.",0
4301,What race is he? They didn't say. The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore. Of course not. That would be racist.,0,But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?,0
4302,"David, imagine meeting you here! Janice, I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning. Is that true? All right! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables. I stole your peaches and flowers. It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen. I also got something this morning.",0,How many vegetables do you steal today?,0
4303,"I stole many from Fred's farm, and from yours. I planned to have a dog on farm. So funny. By stealing, I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work. I could not agree with you more. For us, there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however, I got lots of fun from stealing. I really want to be far away from the reality now.",0,But we still need to go back to it.

4306,"I wanna register for this mathematics course. I’ m sorry registration has closed. Closed? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes. Well, that’ s not possible. The computer’ s official student account has already been sent to the state. And that’ s what our budget is based on. Who told you that anyway?",0,Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee.,0
4307,"She must have been a part-time worker. They didn’ t have much training. Why didn’ t you register then? She said I couldn’ t until I had my birth certificate. Here it is. Huh, that is no reason to demand a birth certificate. We only need to establish residency, you know, a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine. Serious? Only the proof of my address.",6,"Yes, I am afraid she gave you the wrong information.",0
4308,"Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? Sorry, I thought you knew. But you should have told me you were in love with her. Didn't I?",0,You know you didn't.,1
4309,"Well, I'm telling you now. Yes, but you might have told me before. I didn't think you'd be interested. You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her?",1,"Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.",0

4324,"Yeah, they are doing it for fun. Seldom would people like my exercise. It’ s difficult and boring. It’ s true. Many students do the exercise when they have to. We have P. E. once a week. But I think Chinese students need to exercise more. Besides exercise will help them learn new things better. Don’ t students want to have a good memory? Of course. I didn’ t know that. I only know exercise makes bodies stronger. I should take some exercise then. Do you have any suggestions?",0,"Well, do what you like to do. It can be anything. Jogging, doing aerobics, going bicycling, and playing ping-pong. Absolutely anything. Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you. But remember to do some stretches first.",0
4325,"How was your job at the state-owned enterprise? Oh, I no longer work there. I'm working with a multi-national corporation. You changed jobs again? Why do you move so frequently?

That's what I did.",0,And you think about her all the time?,0
4328,"Yes. And maybe you suddenly have new interests. I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid, ie.You used to sleep in every morning, but because she jogs every morning, then you begin to like jogging. That's it. She likes dogs so much now, and I begin to love dogs. Oh, congratulations! Sounds like you’ Ve found your soul mate.",4,"Thanks.

4331,"Wake up, Erik, time to rise and shine. Huh, oh, hi, Jane. I must have fallen asleep while I was reading. You and everyone else. It looks more like a camp-ground than a library.

4332,"No. Prof. Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology. For once I wish she hadn’ t given us so much of a choice. Well, why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico. You seem to be interested in that part of the world. I am, but there is too much material to cover. I’ ll be writing forever, and Grant only wants five to seven pages. So they limit it to one region of Mexico. Say the Yucatan. You’ Ve been there and you said it’ s got lots of interesting relics.",0,That’ s not a bad idea. I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer. That would be great resource material. Now if I can only remember where I put them.,4
4333,I really like my debate class. Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later? I've entertained the idea. But I'm I leaning more toward politics. You want to be a politician? Yuck.,6,That's not like you to generalize.,0

Besides, with all the news about global warming on the news lately, who knows what kind of world we’ ll have in the future. What about you? Well, I’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children. Growing up with only one brother, I always felt a bit lonely. What do you think about families with only one child? For me, growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention. I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn’ t ever have to share.",0,Don’ t you think you would miss having other people around?,0
4335,"No way! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7. you know, I don’ t think I’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents’ home. What do you think of the one-child policy in China? If China didn’ t have such a policy, can you imagine how many people there would be in China now? That’ s true. But as a woman, I’ m glad that even though I don’ t want any children, I at least have a choice in how many children I have.

4339,"Is there a lot of crime in your city? There’ s some, but I don’ t think it’ s a big problem. A lot of it is petty crime, burglary and car theft. There’ s very little major crime. It’ s the same in my city. We also have a lot of drug addicts. A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs. That happens in many places.

The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes, but I don’ t know if that’ s the reason for",0,Some people believe that a tough approach is better.

Well, they used to, but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns. Oh, that's good. I guess the caddies were pleased. Actually, in my opinion, the carts were better because you don't have to tip them.",0,"Yes, but look at it this way, getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people, which is a good thing, right?",0
4345,"Possibly, but I still miss them! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard. One member's caddy fainted last week! How awful, poor guy. Right.

4352,"how could it be? while seeing others going to work or continue their study, I didn't know what I would do. you didn't have an offer? I had one, but I didn't like the job very much. I wanted to attend graduate school, but I was afraid it would be too tough.",5,"I think you lack in the power of decision. Once you make your decision, don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear. Just go full steam ahead!",0
4353,"Ashley, what a great dinner party! Thank you, Joe. What would you like to drink with your meal? I can offer you wine, mango juice, or water. Just water would be fine. Excellent choice. Can I dish you up some chicken?",4,"Yes, the chicken looks wonderful!",4

4356,"My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co. and he let me pick it out. That's so sweet. What was the occasion? That's the best part. It wasn't for anything special. He just wanted to buy me something. You're so lucky. If he bought you something for no special day, I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday.",0,My birthday is coming up. We'll find out pretty soon.,0

I think that South Africa I have no idea what you’ re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl. This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each g Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’ t really appeal to me.",0,"Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will bec",6
4360,"Do you often do exercise? Certainly. OK, and what kind of sports do you usually play? I often play badminton with my parents.",0,You? Play badminton? That's unbelievable! You are shorter than a racket.,6

4362,"Professor, can you help me add your class? You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one? No, I will have to get an add sheet. You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class. Do you know where that is?",0,"No, I don't know where that is.",0
4363,The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be. I think I can find it. You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on. Thank you for letting me add your class.,0,"To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!",0

In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees.,0,In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms.,0
4367,"Yeah, we do. In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, is that true? We do have a few fog days in winter. But I would not say we have a lot of fogs. The sky are usually clearly in your city, are they? Yes, they are like I said we have thunderstorms. But each one usually last a few hours. Then the skys are clear again. Have you ever had snow in your city?",0,My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child. But my parents and I never see it outside of my city.,0

They could generally be divided into two categories",0,"Well, direct ones are the pollution directly from factories, refineries waste treatment plants etc., aren’ t they?",0
4371,"Yeah. They are emitted directly into urban water supplies. But what about the indirect ones? Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater. I see. For the sake of us all, we should be an active participator in the prevention of it.",0,Sure. It's an issue asking for everyone's participation.,0
4372,"Hi, Bill. I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl. Yes, she is my favorite girl. I've decided to go steady with her. Are you sure she is the right girl? Sure. She is the ideal girl, the one I had dreamed of.",4,What type of girl is she?,0

4374,"Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer? Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean. How often do you run your anti-virus program? I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time.",0,Which anti-virus program would you recommend?,0

Then you have to go through the set up procedures. But they are not complicated. What do you use your computer for?,0,"I use it for several things-surfing the net, word processing and creating presentations. I don’ t play many games on my computer, but I do a lot of work with photographs. Using c computer program, you can edit and resize photographs. You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones.",0
4376,"John, you look pale. What happened? I stayed up last night. Did you have something on your mind? You look so concerned! Maybe I can help you! Will, I'm under a lot of pressure. My manager is very pushy. He assigned me two projects. Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them.",0,Is there anything I can do for you?,0
4377,You don't look very well. I'm not feeling too well. I've caught a cold. Is it because of the bad weather? It's been really miserable for the past tew days. Hasn't it! It's been cold and windy recently.Do you like the weather here?,0,"Not really, but I've got used to it now.",0
4378,"They are a nice middle-aged couple, just like us. If they are just like us, they are not middle-aged. Of course they are. Middle-aged means in the middle, Ethel, middle of life. People don't live to a hundred and fifty.",0,"Oh, we are the part on the edge of middle. That's all.",0
4379,"How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events. We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students. We could have a firework display. Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors? If we do, too many people might attend. Perhaps we should invited all of them, but make a small charge to attend.",0,"Good idea. We should also hold a series of presentations. We could have presentations on the history of the university, the courses we offer, and our links with other universities.",4
4380,"Good idea! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives. We could have another on the successes of graduates from here. I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know, T-shirts, mugs, plates, pens, and things like that. That’ s an excellent idea. Hopefully, we would be able to make a profit! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university.",4,I’ m looking forward to reading that. We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni.,4

4383,"Have you considered upgrading your system? Yes, but I'm not sure what exactly I would need. You could consider adding a painting program to your software. It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising. That would be a definite bonus.",4,You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now.,0
4384,"How can we do that? You'd probably need a faster processor, to begin with. And you also need a more powerful hard disc, more memory and a faster modem. Do you have a CD-ROM drive? No. Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too, because most new software programs are coming out on Cds.",0,That sounds great. Thanks.,4
4385,"Hoo, I'm getting tired, Jeanine, been a long day. I'm not quitting yet. You know my favourite slogan, don't you? Yeah, I know. Shop till you drop. Right!",4,I'm getting a little short on cash. Let's just window shop a little.,4

4387,"Now darling, I know that we've bought this house together, but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it. I think we should sell it. Oh, no, Nathan, I... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know. Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more. But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating. I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished. But don't you like this place? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely.",0,"Well, only you liked it really, darling.",0
4388,"I am not sure what to do during the holidays, any suggestions? Well, going to a cinema, visiting the galleries, exhibitions and museums, finding and meeting old friends, exercising in the health club or mountain biking. There are so many good choices. The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun. I just don’ t know what to do first. Why not start with the most interesting one?",0,"Actually, I’ m interested in all of them. The more choices we have, the harder to make a decision.",0
4389,"There is too much traffic in Taipei these days, I think cars should be banned. I'm not sure about that. How would people get to work? Well, why not use buses or the MET?

4394,"Mary, I've some bad news for you. I have already known that. I didn't get the scholarship, right? Yes.

You know I do need the scholarship.",5,I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year.,0
4395,"How can I lose weight, doctor? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food? Well, Jim. It is a combination of how much you eat, the type of food you eat, and when you eat your meals. I never eat breakfast though. That's a big mistake, you should always have a good breakfast. You will not run your car without fuel, and as well you won't expect your body to work without food.",0,I never thought about it that way.,0
4396,"I am confused. How could a golfer need so many clubs? Seems to me, 14 altogether, right I should say, a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs. Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs? In general, a set of golf clubs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, PW ; Woods : 1, 3, 5 and a putter.",0,So many?,0
4397,"Do you remember John from head office? Yes. Have you heard what happened to him? No, what?",0,He had his car stolen. Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car.,0
4398,"What do you mean? Well, apparently, he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in. Crikey. Where did this happen? In Taichung, I think.",0,"Oh, right, I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there.",0
4399,"Really? Well, anyway, they pointed their guns at him and said, you know, keep calm and drive out.... we don't want to hurt you... we just want your car. So what happened? Well, he drove out, and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant, he pretended to have an epileptic fit, you know, to scare the thieves away. The attendant was no help at all, even though the guys were holding guns in plain view, he did nothing. That's terrible.",0,"Yes, makes you think, doesn't it?",0
4400,"Are you a newcomer? Yeah, this is my first visit here. You speak good English, though. Thanks, but I speak English with a strong German accent.",4,"But let me tell you, you're doing just fine. I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German. By the way, how long have you been learning English?",0
4401,"Do you still see the people we went to school with? I did for a while, I suppose, until I left university, but after that not really.

4402,How are you doing? I'm doing great. What movies have you seen lately? I saw Forrest Gump the other day.,0,What type of movie is that?,0
4403,The movie type is drama. I can't believe you are watching movies. The weather is great. You should be outside. I hate the hot weather. I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner. What else do you like to do besides watching movies?,0,"I like to play computer games, read books, go shopping, and play pool.",0
4404,"Out of those what is your favorite? My favorite is to play computer games. What is your favorite computer game? My favorite is Diablo. It used to be Star Craft, but it is getting a little old.",0,"If you like to play so much, when do you ever exercise?",0
4405,"Although I hate to exercise, I go jogging at least twice a week. That's pretty good. By the way, what are you doing next Saturday? I am going to go to the bookstore. I am having a party Saturday night at my house. If you have time, you should come.",4,That sounds like fun.,4
4406,"Shall we sing with a karaoke? Great idea! I do it every so often. For us, karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment. Yep. If you are a good singer, your audience will feel comfortable, right?",4,"I can not agree with you more. And if you are an awful one, that will be funny.",4

4411,"Do you want to go out for dinner tonight? Sure. Have you got anywhere in mind? I'm starving, so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions. That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions. Do you want to go there?",4,"I'm not really in the mood for Italian, actually. I was thinking of something a bit spicy.",4
4412,"If you want spicy food, then I'd recommend going to a Thai, Indian or Chinese restaurant. How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road? I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there. But, they've westernized their food, so it's not actually that spicy. You're right. Most of their dishes have sweet sauces. We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us. The Taj? They're a bit expensive, but they do serve large portions of very hot food.",4,The Taj it is then.,4
4413,Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money? They'll still charge us a corkage fee. That's right. It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway. Don't worry about money. I'll treat you tonight.,4,Are you sure? We could go Dutch.,6
4414,Hello Martin. Have you been to any events yet? Yes I have. I went to the table tennis yesterday. Oh wow. How was it? Oh. It was great. I love Ma Lin. He’ s my favourite table tennis player.

4420,"So Chris, I've heard that you're from a big family. How many people? Nine total. Seven children and my parents. Seven children? That's a lot. Why did your parents have so many? Well, my mother came from a big family, and wanted to have one of her own. My father was an only child, and didn't really care about having a large family, but my mother talked him into it.",0,"Jeez, seven children. That must have a lot of problems. We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right.",0
4421,"It can be hard, and there are certain sacrifices you have to make. Like what? I assume that there's no privacy. That's one. Another is the lack of personal property.

There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me. We have nothing in common.",0,Same problem here. There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.,0

4424,"I've got a letter from my bank here. It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies. Could I see that, please? Yes, here it is. Thanks very much. Well, I'll be able to give you a visa for one year, a student visa, that is.",0,"Oh, but mine is a three-year program.",0
4425,"It's a lovely day out today, isn't it? It's beautiful. Enjoy it while it lasts. It's supposed to get cold tomorrow. What's the weather forecast for tomorrow?

4426,"Do you have any plans for tomorrow? Well, I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends. You might want to change your plans.

4428,"Is there a city where it's always warm? Yes, there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego, for example. Are there any other cities where it's always hot? Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year.",0,But why do so many people live there?,0
4429,"Most people grow accustomed to the climate, but there are many others who complain about it all the time. Are there any cities where it rains a lot? Several.Two good examples are Seattle, in the state of Washington, and Portland, Oregon. Tell us about some cold cities.",0,In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them.,0
4430,"Mark, you are not telling me the truth. Now why? Promise you are not going to be angry? Yes, all right. So why? Go on then. Say it. Oh, really, Mark. I promise I'm not going to be angry. Now why were you late? I forgot.",0,You forgot? You...,6
4431,Long time no see! Yes. It has been a long time since the last time we met. It's nice to see you again. Have you changed jobs? No. I've been visiting relatives recently.,0,That's nice. Where have you been?,0

4433,"I'm really fed up with Larry! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes, and he's a pain to work with. You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office, it will make a bad working environment for everybody. You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic. I've never met anyone as cheery as she is. Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around, but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary, on the other hand, spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also, she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp.",0,"Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker? What about Bob? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green, he is a great co-worker.",0

4435,"Hello everyone, and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for? Cardiopulmonary resuscitation! That’ s right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest. What does that mean?",0,"Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again! That’ s when we have to apply this procedure. Let’ s begin! I need a volunteer.",0
4436,"Me! Me! Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’ s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.

I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.",0,"Well, OK. But no French kissing!",0

I knew Sally would finally show her true colors. When she got her final test results back from Mr. Leo, she started yelling at him. You should have heard her.

4444,"Tomorrow night would work for me. Should we just meet here? OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation. I'll see you then.",0,See you tomorrow night.,0
4445,Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school? Really? Why? He had moved and held a party on July 1st. It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time.,0,"Even he's not coming back to school anymore, you still can call him and meet him on weekends.",0
4446,"I went to Rotes’, you know, Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths. Is she? I thought she was a mathematician. I’ m so thirsty. Are you? I thought you had something to drink at her home.",6,No. Edith didn’ t give anything to drink.,0
4447,"How long will it take us to drive to London? I think it’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London, so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway. That’ s unless there is a traffic jam. It could take three hours. You’ re right. We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey, because we will be in built-up area.",0,"So, shall we allow three hours to cover the distance?",0
4448,"Ok. You haven’ t seen my company car, have you? No. let me take a look... It’ s longer than my car. I think it’ s over five meters long. I can’ t remember exactly. It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour. Wow! That’ s fast! I don’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway.",6,"We can’ t. if we went that fast, we would break the speed limit.",0
4449,"I’ m Miss Sherman. What seems to be the problem? Well, apparently I’ Ve run up quite a bill. I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night. I’ Ve just been informed that it’ s actually 500 do That’ s true. For the Junior Executive Room... three nights... yes, your bill should be $ 1,500 But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750.",0,The advertised rate is based on double occupancy.,0
4450,"When I booked the room, your staff didn’ t mention this. And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that. Are you quite sure? Yes. Have a look. I see. I had no idea our advertising was so misleading. It is here, but it’ s in the fine print on the last page.",0,Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate.,0

Let’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly, so we can go our separate ways, alright? Fine with me. I just want to get this over with. It’ s important we make a clean break. I should have signed a pre-nup. What was that? Nothing! Anyway, you’ re right, there’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that’ s done... finally.",0,"Let’ s not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let’ s start with the record collection, I’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.",0
4455,"Fine, but I’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me. I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it! He’ s my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway! Whatever! Alright, I’ ll concede the silly gramophone, if you’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set.",0,"How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What’ s next? What about these old photographs?",0
4456,"Which ones? Let me have a look.Wow, look at that! That brings back memories... That? Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trev fountain, and we got caught in the rain... ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

4464,"Do you have much experience with kids? Yes. I have three sons. Actually I also have a grandson. To tell you the truth, sometimes I regret having a baby so early. I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby. I understand. I was in your position before. At that time I couldn’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me. My husband seldom stayed at home.",0,What about your mother? Did she help you?,0
4465,"Yes, she did a little. But you see, Americans are different from Chinese. You can’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter. She could baby-sit only once or twice a week. That’ s it. I had to care for them most of the time. I see. So if my little family goes to America, I would end up taking care of my child all the time. My husband would have to make the bread for us. I just don’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day. Don’ t worry. You can take night classes. I did that when I had kids. And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten. Then you could find a job and work. Sounds not so easy to me. When that happens, I will be too old to learn.",0,"No. You see, I went back to school to get my Master’ s Degree when I was in my thirties. You won’ t be older than that.",0
4466,"Now I know why I split up with Mike. We found we were simply not good for each other. In what ways? Well, he is a typical Sagittarius guy, while I am a Cancer. We aren't really compatible Ha-ha, so you believe in astrology?",4,"What's strange about that! As a person born under the sign of Cancer, I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life. But according to astrology, Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life.",0

But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune.",0,So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then?,0

4474,I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning. Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue. So did I. that's why I didn't take my umbrella. I got cold in the rain in the afternoon. It was raining cats and dogs. I know. I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm. It was pouring with rain all afternoon.,0,We really have some movable weather sometime. I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round.,0

4479,"Linda, would you care for some candies or cookies? No, don't try to tend me. I'm becoming chubby, and I have to slender down. You are not really chubby. You are actually thin enough. I don't think so. I know I've put on weight this winter.",0,"So you are watching your weight, aren't you?",0
4480,"What happened to your brother? It seems that he has gone ape over the girl. Your parents must be worrying about him. Yes, he’ s been like this for two weeks. We don’ t know what to do.",0,Have you talked to him?,0

What methods do you use to conserve water? Water is rationed. We can only use a certain amount each month. It means that we cannot use some modern household items, like washing machines. They use too much water.",0,I see. I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution.,0

4495,"So Kim, have you ever had anything stolen? Stolen? No, why? My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago. I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days. Criminals are clever? They’ re only successful when people are careless.",0,I don’ t know. The ones who stole my uncle’ s motorcycle were pretty good.,0
4496,"If your uncle had an alarm system, then it wouldn’ t have happened. He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn’ t stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too. Didn’ t anyone stop them? You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away.",0,"Wow, they were good. I guess criminals aren’ t that dumb after all.",0
4497,"A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days. He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it. He recommended me to subscribe to it. What do you say? I think it is good if we know enough about career planning. We will make wiser choices. What else did he tell you about it? Well, just something in general, like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals. Sounds practical! To be honest, sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills.",0,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. It seems that you need this course more than I do.

4505,"I thought you were the only child in the family. Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s? Yes, it did. But my parents are ethnic minority people. It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children. Interesting. What do you think about families with only one child? The child must feel very longly. My younger brother is 10 years younger than me. Before he was born, I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day.",0,Do you get along well with each other?,0
4506,"Every year, the South has the floods. It is an act of God. Do you really think so? Yeah, you have some other ideas? I think, in some way it is an act of God, but in another way, it just is caused by us.",0,For example?,0

4510,"It's a lovely day, isn't it? Yeah, and most excitingly, I met the girl living under me today. She's really nice. Is she American? Yeah, and most importantly, she's single! Man, I could tell from the moment I saw her, she's the girl of my dreams!",4,"So I take it you two are hitting it off? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor, but what if you break up?",0
4511,"I don't know. I am not really worried about that. I don't wanna lose before even starting. Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her. Sounds like you've got some competition. You made a move already? Not yet. But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime. I know some good restaurants nearby. That's nice. Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage, eh?",0,"You bet. Now that you mentioned it, I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight.",4
4512,"Are you feeling better today, Bill? Well, it’ s hard to say. I coughed a lot in the evening. You’ d better give up smoking. It’ s bad for your health. You’ re right. But you know it’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking.",0,But you should make up your mind first.,0
4513,Oh! What fools we were! To think of it! All my old silver! It meant so much to me. And my new car. To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car. That's what hurts me most.,0,"What's so terrible too, is the fools we've made of ourselves.",5
4514,"I just saw Something About Mary last night. It was hilarious. David took me to it last week. I thought it was a little sick. What do you mean sick? It was really funny, don't you think? It was entertaining in some ways. But in general I didn't like it.",0,Why not?,0
4515,"I just think the humor was too gross. There were too many disgusting things in it. I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny. It wasn't a dirty movie. There wasn't even any nudity. No, you're right. But nudity doesn't bother me. What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation, stuff like that. It was too sick. Oh, you are too conservative. It's just realistic.",0,I don't think it's realistic. I thought it was sick. Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor?,0
4516,"Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing? I heard that they are very famous in China. Yes. Especially in autumn, the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red. That must be very beautiful. Yes, it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies.",4,Really? Have you ever been there?,4
4517,"Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced? I didn't hear that. But I can deduce the reason. Really? Say it! Tom is a kind guy, but addicted to gambling. He spends all his time gambling in the casino. And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer, so she divorced him. Is that right?",0,"Yeah, quite right. Gambling broke up a happy family.",0
4518,"Professor, could I make an appointment with you? I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind? Two o'clock would be the best time. Fine, do you know where my office is?",0,"No, I'm not sure.",0

4520,Have you gone bowling before? No. Could you tell me something more about it? I want to play well. There are 10 frames in a bowling game. Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame. You just said 10 rounds.,0,' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms.,0
4521,"Hectic. It's always hectic. But how was your windsurfing? I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting, but... well... I couldn't really do it. See? I told you. It's very hard. I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail. I probably fell down fifty times.",0,Fifty times?,0

4524,"You didn’ t show up in the morning meeting. What’ s up? Well, I just came in. I worked overtime yesterday. Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate. So I stayed to double check them. The boss was aware of my very late work of last night. So before he left office, he told me I could come one hour later this morning. But you still look a little bit tired. What time did you leave? It was around one thirty in the morning. I guess I didn’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind. I just couldn’ t stop thinking about them.",0,"That’ s normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.",0

When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over. It looks like someone beat you up.

We'll have to call in the electrician, he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM, and it will probably take him an hour a light.

Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don’ t want to drop them on your feet!",0,"When I do push-ups, should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground?",0
4967,"You don’ t need to bend your elbows that much. Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight. Many people bend their bodies at the waist, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise. What’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles? One that I recommend is that you lie on your back.

Yes, we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos. We can see you are experienced in this particular line.",4,Thank you.,4
5039,"But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative. After all, you sold around 400 pieces there last year. You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end. That is the result of our hard work. Well, what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then? 500 pieces. No, no. That's too big a number to be acceptable. Let's put it at 450 pieces. And we'll strive to sell more, of course. We wish to add another clause. For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota, we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts.",0,"All right, let's fix it at 450 pieces then. And for every additional 50 pianos sold, we'll give you 1 % higher commission.",0
5040,"I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged. We would like to make a specific mention of one more point. As our sole distributor, you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own. No, certainly not. That's a reasonable restriction. Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products.",0,"Yes, we've already prepared one. I've brought it with me. I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow.",0
5041,"I think we have had a very pleasant conversation, haven't we? Yes, I think so too. Do you have any other questions? Let me think... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee.",0,I'm sorry we can't now.,0

5045,"Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! That's not very fair. What did you do? There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired me for sure. Does he treat everyone in your department like this?",0,"He treats everyone pretty badly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake!",1
5046,Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company? Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion.,0,That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders.,0
5047,I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week. What about income? Did you make any money during that period?,0,My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period.,0
5048,"When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income? Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form. What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away. I am not going to show any income from now on then.",0,I wouldn’ t do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements.,0
5049,"Jane! What an enchanting skirt you have on! Thank you! Guess how much it costs. Bright colors, smooth material, exquisite craftsmanship, soft lines... Darling, it looks elegant on you! It can't be any cheap stuff. Something around two hundred, I guess. Your offer is way off the mark. It set me back only sixty-five.",0,"Then you got a windfall! Was sixty-five the original price, or did you get a special discount?",0
5050,"Neither. I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down. How much did she ask for? Three hundred! That's daylight robbery. How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me? Without hesitation, I gave my offer---no more than fifty. She must be fuming with anger at such a bid, wasn't she?",0,"Not at all! She's really been around, and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this. That's the trade. She only demanded a higher bid, saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy. She was lying! Then I inquired, ' May I have it at sixty? ' she waved her head.",0
5051,"Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude. I am Mr. Foster, and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people.

5055,"I need to find a new place to live. Yeah? Why? Don’ t you like living with me? Oh, it’ s not you. I just want my own place. Well, check the newspaper.",0,Jeez... I didn’ t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days.,6

5057,"You must be Mr.Sellers. I'm Steven. I am here to see the apartment you advertised. Oh, nice to see you. The apartment is on the tenth floor. The previous tenant just moved out yesterday. Could I have a look at it first? Sure. Let me show you the way. Here we are. Apartment 1008. ( They enter. ) This is the living room dining room combination. Here's the kitchen.

5058,"Yes. And there's a walk-in closet. Is there air conditioning? Yes, there's central air conditioning and heating. The thermostat is in the living room 。 What's the house rent? When is the rent due? And how much security deposit do you require?",0,It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month. We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit. It will be returned to you at the end of your lease.,0
5059,"I think if I’ m going to find a job, I’ ll look over the job board. Well, there’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section. Right, so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning. Did you get a copy of the Herald too?",0,"No, why should I? The Globe’ s help wanted section is the best.",0
5060,"That’ s true, but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn’ t have. Not enough to worry about. Why do I waste the money buying two papers? It's only a couple of dollars more. For that much money you can afford to risk it. I guess you’ re right. I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe.",0,Good idea.,0
5061,"Mary, today a man from an intermediary gave me a call. What did he say? He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet, and could offer me an appropriate job. What kind of intermediary is it?",0,It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses.,0
5062,"What job did he recommend to you? It's on telemarketing. Does he ask you to pay some fees? No, he said the employers will pay for it.",0,Then what do you think about it?,0
5063,"I have a parking ticket to pay for. Did you bring your ticket? Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today. Did you bring your ID?",0,I didn't bring my ID.,0
5064,"You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket. What do you need my ID for? We have to know that this ticket is really yours. All right, I see what you mean.",0,"Next time you come back, bring your ID.",0
5065,"Here's the dress you wanted it to be made. Oh, dear! What's the matter? It's not what I asked for.",0,What's wrong with it?,0
5066,"Can I help you, sir? Yes, please. I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife. What kind of presents do you want? Actually, I don't know exactly. Do you have anything recommended?",0,"OK. How about some very cool sneakers for your children? Anyway, it won't cost you much. It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair. It might be cheaper than that in America.",0
5067,"Hey, How did you know I came from America? Just a hunch, sir. How much again? $ 59.95.",0,"That's really cheap for shoes like those. OK, I'll take 5 pairs.",4
5068,"Sorry, sir. Why not? Because in this duty-free shop, your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife. Oh, my God. I've totally forgotten about that. Anyway, I think she would like a bottle of perfume.",0,That's good. And I can also recommend you a good one. It's the brand of DENY.,4
5069,"DENY? That's very expensive in America. It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY? It's $ 60 here. That's very unbelievable. Is it fake? Of course not, sir.",0,"OK, I'll take one.",0
5070,"Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house. To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars. I think that maybe I should accept their offer. You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up with another offer.",0,"I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house.",0
5071,"There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try one more offer if you like. I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer. After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with your offer. Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?",0,I don’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer.,0
5072,"You heard who won the election, right? Who was elected? McCain won the election. That can’ t be true!",6,"I’ m upset, too.",0
5073,I can’ t believe people voted for him. People must want him as our President. That doesn’ t make any sense. I have more bad news.,0,How could the news get any worse?,0
5074,When could we meet to discuss the project? I will be available on Monday or Tuesday. Choose which day is best for you. I prefer Monday. Good. Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best?,0,Either one is OK.,0
5075,"Great! When I check with the others, I will send you an exact time. When you come, be prepared to do your presentation. I will be prepared to do my presentation. Who would you like to see there? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee? Everyone needs to be there.",0,That will probably be best. Do you need help with directions?,0
5076,"May I help you, ma'ma? Please, where do I catch the plane for New York? First you must check in at Counter No. 4. That one there?",0,That's right. Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85.,0

5079,I'm still feeling under the weather. Would you like anything for your stomach? I took something earlier. Get better.,4,Thanks a lot.,4
5080,"Do you want some dessert? No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress? Where is our waitress anyway? Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?",0,"I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.",0
5081,Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together. So the bill is $ 36.00. How much do you think we should leave for a tip? My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.,0,"I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.",0
5082,"Are you introverted or extroverted? I wouldn't call myself introverted. Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much. But other times I like sharing activities with others too.

5083,I'm having problems with my computer. What's wrong with it? For some reason it won't turn on. Have you checked the connections on your computer?,0,What connections?,0
5084,There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet. Will the cords keep it from turning on? It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected. I didn't think of that.,0,Try it and see if it works.,0

5086,"I don’ t have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired. Have you been under a lot of stress lately? I just lost my job, and I am unsure about being able to find another one. Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed?",0,"I haven’ t ever tried that, but it sounds like a good idea.",0

5090,"Hello! How do I restock my minibar? You've drunk everything, sir? I finished it all. Do you want the whole minibar, or just certain items?",0,Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.,0
5091,"That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers. Anything else, sir? The apples in my room were delicious. Bring me a few more, please. Okay. Are you sure there isn't anything else?

5092,"Could I see the manager please? I have a complaint to make. Yes, I’ m the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam? Did you have the room checked before we move in? Which room are you in?",0,1808. The toilet doesn’ t work properly. The water doesn’ t run in the shower.,0

5097,"can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding. sure. What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from? it depends on the price, but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend. that will probably be quite expensive, but the more you pay for the fabric, the longer it'll last and the better it'll look. What color do you want the suit to be?",0,I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit.,0
5098,"brown, huh? Isn't that a bit dull? haven't you heard? Brown is the new black. why don't you just get black? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral, a wedding, a job interview — anything! that may be true, but black is so boring. Anyway, I already have three black suits. I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest.",0,here are two different shades of brown. Which one do you prefer?,0

5101,"It’ s only seven miles. We turn left to join the motorway and drive south. According to the map, we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25. That’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London. That’ s another 15 miles, so that’ s 22 miles total so far. Then we drive west on the M25. we must be careful to turn in the right direction!",0,"Then we drive on the M25. it turns south. When we reach exit 15, we turn left and go west along the M4.",0

So how many miles is that together? 22 miles to the M25, 33 miles on the M25, and 3 after that. That’ s a total of 58 miles, isn’ t it? It shouldn’ t take us very long to cover that distance. Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way.",0,We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn’ t much traffic. I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there. Being early is much better than being late.,0

5106,"and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision? yeah, after receiving my yearly bouns, I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market. I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received absolutely. With your expertise and experience, you're clearly working below your pay grade. that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one.",0,"this way, you'll earn more at the new work place.",0
5107,"I’ d like to have this cashed, please. Please put your name and address here. May I see your passport. Yes. How would you like it?",0,Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please.,0
5108,"We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off, Joe. Yes, I know. The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05, and now it's 16:15.

5113,"I'm glad we came here. This is really delicious! I was worried you would think it was too far to drive. Well, it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really, I think it's worth it. I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food, you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer.",0,"How do you mean "" suffer ""?",0
5114,"I mean, in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better. Even in the winter? Yes, even in the winter. And even if it takes two hours, huh?",0,Why not? I've been craving good food for three weeks now. I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza!,4
5115,"Well, this really is delicious, I have to admit. I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining. Don't tease me! Good food is really important to Chinese! I know. I can see that. This is what is called "" dim sum, "" right? Yes, all these dishes are different "" dim sum "" dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America.",0,"So when you Chinese think of Chinatown, you mostly think of food. Is that right?",0
5116,"Of course. I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment. And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner, after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants. No way! What do you mean?",0,"We're going up to the "" new "" Chinatown for dinner. I already know where we're going to go.",0
5117,"Alright, alright. I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again? No, dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time, or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the "" new "" Chinatown. Taiwanese style? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style? No, dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan.",0,I wonder if you can cook things this good.,4
5118,"Pam, where's the closest ATM? It's not that far. Do you see that Yellow building over there? The big one or the small one? The big one.",0,Yes.,0
5119,"It's right next to it, on the right. Do you know if there's a convenience store around here? I don't think there's one around here. The closest one is on 3rd street, but that's probably closed now. I really need to get some things before I leave.",0,"Well, you could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.",0

5127,"Mr. Li, the report has been finished. So fast! Thank you. You're welcome. This is my duty. Anything else? Yes, you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer, and then send those materials to each business worker.",0,"OK, I'll do it right now.",0
5128,"Dad, do you know where Mom is? I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you. She'd better not start crying like she usually does. I know, but she is going to miss you something awful. Have I told you how proud I am of you?",0,"Dad, now don't you go getting mush on me.",0

5137,"You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products. Through our continuous effort, consumers tend to accept your product. So, there will be a potential market for your product in this area, and would you let us act as your agent? We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city. But according to our record, your annual turnover is not too big, so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency. If that's the case, we can talk about it first. What's your concept of a big amount? I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least.",0,I'm afraid that's too much for us.,0
5138,"We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us. However, our company has the regulation for the agency. All right, we accept the challenge. What about the commission? You know, we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal. I am sorry to say that it's a little higher. Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission. You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries. At the beginning of our campaign, there is sales resistance to overcome, we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs. A 20 % commission will not leave us much.",0,"Our price is worked out according to the costing. A 20 % commission means an increase in our price. So, I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent.",0
5139,"We’ Ve got a lot of work to do now, but take your time over this project. We don’ t want to make any mistakes. Ok. I should have it finished by Friday afternoon. Then I can check those account over the weekend. We need to have them finished by Monday, right? That’ s right. We’ ll finish them just in time. The Macy project can wait for the time being.

Some next week on, we should be in less of a rush.",0,I’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off. Everyone deserves it.,0
5140,Don’ t say that yet. A new project could suddenly appear. That’ s true. Right. I’ m going back to the meeting. It’ s been going on for hours and there’ s no indication that it’ ll end soon.

I really hope this meeting doesn’ t last too long.,0,They usually go on for ages.,0
5141,Where did you get assigned to go this time around? They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there. And you? Hong Kong again.

5147,"Me! Me! Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.

I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.",0,"Well, OK. But no French kissing!",0

It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you. Oh, it will be so expensive! I have a special medical plan, and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor. Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry.",0,"This is ridiculous! In Taiwan, it is much easier to get medicine when I need it.",1

I could have this everyday! Ok, now for the last and best dish in my opinion. This is called Pad Thai. It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

5209,"I've read your report, and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days? That's right. I know it must sound crazy to you, but we believe there will be fewer absences this way. We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year. Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help. It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me. Right now, we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues.",0,"I see. So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work, resulting in more sick employees.",0

My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law, where I have been able to apply my paralegal education. I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts. I really love research and analyzing facts.

What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession? Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job. In my last position, I supported four lawyers, and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week. There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything. I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball.

Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome. I remember a case that was filled with obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances. I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step. I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch. Through some hard work and fact digging, I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles. I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations, which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done. What are your strengths and weaknesses?",0,"My strengths are my caring about getting the job done. I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs.

I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any problems since that day. When do you find a job satisfying? My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job.

5639,"Put it beside you. Don’ t pile your purses, briefcase and other belongings on the employer’ s desk. You've got long hair. Don’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer.

What's that? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write, it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours. No, I did that a long time ago. It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus.",0,"He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real? How old is he, eight?",6
6117,"Yes. He's never said anything so I never told him. But now that he's getting older... You think it's better that he should be told? Yes, he's too old to believe in that type of things. And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do. That happened to my oldest girl. She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real.",0,"I can understand. I was lucky with my oldest, she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son.",0
6118,"Hello, this is 5735647 5. Hello, this is John. I wanna speak to Linda, please. This is Linda. Hi, Linda. I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening.",0,Really? What time and which restaurant?,6

6120,"What’ s the matter, dear? Something awful happened. We went to the Portobello Road, and someone stole my handbag. Oh, dear. Did you lose a lot of money? No. Only a few pounds. But my passport was in the bag. That’ what I’ m really worry about.",5,You must tell the embassy about it. And I think they’ ll issue you with a new one.,0
6121,"Hello, May I help you? Yes, we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent. Oh, how nice! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet. That is exactly what we're looking for.",0,"Well, each room is 40 dollars a week.",0
6122,"That sounds all right to us. When do you want to move in? How about tomorrow afternoon? Fine, I'll be expecting you.",4,See you tomorrow.,4
6123,"Mon and I got in another fight, Boris. oh, Iris! what was it about this time? it was over food. I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no. I believe she was right. You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat.",0,"oh, she keeps saying that. She never allows me to have them.",0
6124,"I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth. But, Boris, i am not a baby any more. well, that's true. how about your mother?",0,she also believes in healthy diet. And she requires us to have regular meals.,0
6125,"poor you. It seems we are in the same boat.

But we've just been too busy to look for a house. We need to find a good realtor.",0,"Not necessary. If we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive.",0
6127,"What do you mean? Realtors always get a commission. If the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him. But doesn't a realtor help with the contract? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles. Yes, that's often true. But you have to pay them.",0,"I still think we should have a realtor. We're new in this country. We don't know all the laws of buying a house. And also, the realtor will inspect the house. He can tell us if the house has any problems.",0
6128,"Of course we need a house inspector. But we can hire an inspector on our own. As for the legal problems, I have friends. They can help us. So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor? It takes a little more time. We have to check the ads in the paper. Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads. Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them. And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor?",0,"Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves.",0
6129,"Why? That is because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher. He will have to pay a commission to the realtor. Hmm. It all sounds very complicated. It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time. That's why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome.",0,I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like.,0
6130,"So, got any more ideas for the website? Well, since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes, I made a "" for guests only "" gift chat room. But we registered at Macy's. People can just buy gifts there. The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America. The chat room is more convenient.",0,You're right. They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things.,0
6131,Or discuss what gifts they could buy together. Any other ideas? We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments. And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures...,0,"Yeah, that will be the best part. Jack hasn't seen yours yet, right?",0

6137,"Thanks for coming in today, did you have any trouble finding us? Please take a seat. Thank you. So, let’ s get started. tell me a bit about your educational background. Sure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose this course of study for two reasons.

And, your postgraduate studies?",0
6138,"Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master’ s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service. Very good.

6140,"Are you interested in mountaineering? Yes. in some sense. I should say I like mountain climbing, you know, because I'm not so professional. How about you? I'm the same with you, an amateur mountain climber. 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation. We spent two days in the mountains. How did you spend the night there?",0,"We pitched a tent in the night, waiting for the sunrise. Wow! It was too beautiful.",4

6142,"Bob! Your eyes look bloodshot. Did you not sleep well? I had a drop too much last night. I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine. And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table. You have it right. Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China. Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship, especially in Northern China. I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me. But if I keep gulping down one cup after another, I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick.",0,"You lose face by refusing to drink, and the host might think you refuse to give him face. The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up. This will endear you to your friends.",0

6648,"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes, their parents would offer me a cup of hot, strong tea, though they never inquired of me about whether I want it. You've got a point there. It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit. There is no need to ask if he needs it or not, or if he wants something else. It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea. So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip. In that case, I guess, in return, the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it. It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop. But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face.

It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. They reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. To our astonishment, about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. We can't accept them in this state. They are unfit for human consumption. And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them. Is that so? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. Have you any evidence?",6,"Certainly. Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London, whose testimony is absolutely reliable.",0
6776,"Though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. What's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage. The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. It is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing. As you know, before shipment, the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question. They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export. I think the Inspection Bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. The part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment, I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss.",0,"The inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods F. O. B. Houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. Your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment.",0

6881,"Oh, my God! What's this? What? Look! This window is open. Did you open it before we left?",0,Are you kidding? It's winter. Why would I open it?,6
6882,"I don't know. Wait. Is this yours? No! Oh, my God! Someone has broken into the house. It looks that way. That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in.

6893,"Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often? First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.",0,"Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’ t seem like a waste of time and money.",0

You put some oil and heat it up, so it's quite hot, and then you take your whipped up eggs, or whisked up eggs, and pour them into the pan, and as it's cooking, if you take a spatula, and push the bottom layer of the egg, to the side, to the sides, and then to the middle, so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan. Oh, OK. Wow! OK. And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over, you'll only have to cook that side lightly. Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese. Wow. That sounds really good.",4,"Mm, it is.",0

I'm on my way to the dinner now. It's OK, don't worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. All right. What varietal is that?",0,"Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label.

This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.",0

Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’ t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’ s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I bloody it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’ s another twenty minutes or so.

7630,"What do you want, Essie? A cup of coffee and an apple pie. How about you? I don't want coffee. I'd like some orange juice. Why don't you drink coffee?",0,I don't like coffee in this cafe.,0

7635,"Well, what did you think about the last candidate? Do you think we should hire her? She had a very impressive resume, but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs. What made you think that she wasn't very confident? Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked?",0,"She was a bit nervous, I guess. What else?",0
7636,"When she first walked into the room to greet us, she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all. I thought that was a bit unprofessional. you're right. If she walked into meetings with our clients like that, it would make our company look bad, wouldn't it? It sure would. Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview? She had horrible posture! I agree. I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language.",0,"On top fo all of that, she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space. she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting.",2
7637,"My throat is really dry. Do you want to go get something to drink? Yes, I'm parched. What did you want to drink?",0,I was thinking about getting a soda.,0

7639,"I have a feeling you will get this job. Thanks. But I'm not so sure. Interviews stress me out. Just remember to be professional and polite. Oh, and don’ t forget to smile. I’ ll do my best, but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations.",0,Have you updated your resume recently?,0
7640,"Yes... ah! I forgot to include my e-mail address. You’ d better double-and-triple check it. You don’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume.

Oh, do you have a reference letter?",0,Sort of. I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic.,0

7644,I'd like to have internet on my computer. Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get? What are my options? You can either get dial-up or DEL.,0,Which one would you recommend?,0
7645,DEL is the best choice. Why is DEL better? It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line. What exactly does that mean?,0,"Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.",0
7646,"So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a restaurant. I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner? She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her. Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very upscale, with a three-star rating.",0,I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another restaurant?,0
7647,"Can I get you any dessert? Yes, I'd like to try the blueberry pie. Excellent choice. ( He brings her the pie. After she finishes, the waiter comes back. ) Would you like anything else? No, I'm stuffed. I'm ready for the check.",0,Here you are. Thank you and have a nice evening.,4

7649,"I think I'm polite, careful, relaxed and shy. Oh, I don't think you're shy! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party. Well.

I love going out and making new friends.",0,"So, you'll be at my birthday party on Friday?",4

7652,"Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height. Is this OK? So far, so good. How come you are walking away?",0,"I am not leaving. I just need you to take a really deep breath, hold it, and then let it out.",0
7653,"Do you have a free moment? Sure, what do you need? I am having some trouble. How do you use this printer? Well. First you have to turn this switch on.",0,Silly me.,5
7654,"I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong, please. For what days, madam? Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th. Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat?",0,I prefer to sit next to a window.,0
7655,Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image. Surely it is. You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him. You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words.,0,"When you are seated, bent forward a little with your hands crossed, to show you respect the interviewer.",0
7656,Don't move from time to time. It is very impolite and will make you nervous. Proper posture can show your confidence. The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer. Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well.,0,Throughout the interview you should maintain patience.,0
7657,"Hello, Elizabeth. How are you? Fine, thanks. Are you sure you're all right? You look a bit worried today. Is anything wrong? Well, yes, there is something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.",0,"Of course, if I can.",0

But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly.",0
7659,"Oh dear! What a pity! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre? Yes, quite sure. I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily, saying when and where you lost it. But that takes too long.",0,Wait a minute! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre. I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it. You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later.,0
7660,"Hi, Francis, morning! How are you doing today? I had a bad start of the day. I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting. Indeed, I agree that is not a good start. How about the meeting? You missed anything important? It is ok. My boss briefs me later on.",0,Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting?,0

7662,"if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young, they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats. i didn't know that. Are rabbits difficult to take care of? not really. I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time, to give her food and water, and to clean its that sounds pretty easy.

A trial will convince you of my words.",0,"If you can go a little lower, I'd be able to give you an order on the spot.",0

This segment of the industry is well developed. Sorry to interrupt, Doris, but can you tell me more about these tour groups, what kind of things they enjoy, and so on? Yes, of course. Most of the time, when they travel, they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide, who usually takes care of everything, for instance, choosing the restaurants, the itinerary, the mode of transport, and things like that. Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged, around 40 to 50 or so. This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels, and have money to spend. They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer. They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything. I don’ t mean to interrupt, but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market?",0,"Just a moment. I'll tell you about that in a minute. Where was I? Oh yes.

8362,"Hi, Zina. Lots of people are looking for you. Like who? Like Elvin. He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com. I've got it under control.",0,You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week?,0
8363,"Good morning, how have you been doing? I haven’ t been able to take a deep breath lately, and I need to know why. Have you had any type of bug lately? No, I’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time. It just is hard to breathe.",0,Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies?,0
8364,"No one has ever checked me for allergies. Does this happen more when you are under stress? When the weather gets really cold, it gets worse. I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma.",0,Thank you for pursuing this. I appreciate your help.,0
8365,"Let's go to Wangfujing by bus. Better take the subway. It's faster, and more convenient. OK, it will be a new experience for me. We have a rather comprehensive subway system here. You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway, especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy.",0,Where do we pay the fare?,0
8366,"Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token. Then, you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in. Let me pay for it. Where can I get a subway map? Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one. It's free fo charge. Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations. Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains?",0,"No, you don't have to. Here comes the train.",0
8367,"How are you, Sue? Pretty good. I’ Ve just had my new poems published. Congratulations on your success. Thank you.",4,And how’ s your brother?,0

8371,"Well, Yuri, tell me about it. I'm sorry I can't bring better news, sir. The site is a disaster. That's what I was afraid of. It is not only the earthquake, sir. But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud.",0,Mud? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district. I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango.,6
8372,"That's what we thought, sir. That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too. Right above our site. Oh, that's terrible! What bad luck! I wish we had never come to this country.But, if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries, it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished! I'm sorry, sir. It's not your fault, Yuri.But tell me. When will Ivan be able to get out there?",0,"Well, it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight, I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch.",0
8373,"Good. I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible. But sir... Yes, Yuri? I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night. The roads aren't safe.",0,Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too?,0
8374,"No, sir. The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting, sir. Are you serious? Fighting? But I didn't hear anything on the news. You know the government controls the press here, sir. They don't want it reported. Oh, this is terrible, Yuri. Terrible! So we can't even assess the damages. How can we do business in this country? Either we're buried under mud, or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No, I can't believe this mess!",5,"I'm sorry, sir.",5
8375,Your dog is really cute. What's his name? His name is Bingo. What kind of dog is he? We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away.,0,"Well, he sure likes to run around a lot. Is he well behaved?",0
8376,"Oh yes, he is. When he was a puppy, he liked to chew my father's shoes, but he's okay now. That sounds like my cat. She likes to scratch the couch with her claws. I didn't know you had a cat. When did you get her? About a year ago actually. You've probably never seen her though.",0,Really? Why is that?,0
8377,You are seemingly upset. What's behind you? Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered. But I have no idea on the registering process. That's not as complicated as you suppose. Is it so easy? I never experienced this. Can you tell me something about it?,0,It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks. And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field.,0
8378,"Hello sir, how can I help you? Yes, I need this prescription please. Let’ s see. Okay, so 50 mg of Prozac, would you prefer this in capsule or tablet? Capsules are fine.",0,"Okay, you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day. Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach, and also, don’ t ever mix it with alcohol!",0
8379,"Yes, I know. It’ s not the first time I’ m taking this! Don’ t worry, I won’ t overdose! Okay, anything else I can get you? Oh, yes, I almost forgot! Can I also get some eye drops and um, some condoms? Sure. Darn condoms aren’ t registered in our system.",0,"Oh, well that’ s okay, I’ ll get some later, thanks... Really it’ s no problem.",0
8380,"Good coming, sir. Good morning. Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus? Of course not. But I don't know when to get off.",0,Where are you going?,0
8381,"I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company. This is the assembly line. These drawings on the wall are process sheets.

8382,Sorry. What was that you said? I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven. Where? At the Gate.,0,"When, did you say?",0
8383,"Round about seven. Who's coming? Peter. Peter Brown, you know. Don't forget to bring the letter. Sorry. I didn't quite catch what you said. There's a lot of noise outside.",0,I told you not to forget to bring the letter.,0
8384,We’ re asking for donations today. What are you collecting donations for? We’ re trying to raise money for the campaigns. How much are you planning on raising?,0,As much as possible.,0
8385,"What kind of fundraisers are you doing? We are going door to door. You should try actual fundraisers, too. What else can we do?",0,Try having a car wash or selling candy.,0
8386,Excuse me.My bag was stolen.Will you help me? When did it happen? Just about half an hour ago. Tell me where it happened and how?,0,Yes.It was just when I was walking in the park. I saw some children with a newspaper.,0

8388,"I love eggplant! Unfortunately, it’ s quite expensive in my country, so I don’ t eat it often. Why is it relatively expensive? Because we don’ t grow it much in my country. We import a lot from other countries. I see. We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country. We export a lot of melons, grapes, oranges and lemons. In your country, do you eat corn on the cob? It's very popular in my country.",0,"We eat it in my country too, but I wouldn't say it’ s very popular. Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket.",0
8389,"Do you mind if I ask you a question? If it’ s too personal you can forget it. I don’ t mind at all. You can ask me anything. We’ re friends. Have you got a scholarship, or are you on your own? I have a scholarship from my government for four years. How about you?",0,I have a tuition scholarship from the university. Otherwise I’ m on my own.,0
8390,I am so busy today. Can I help you? I’ m not sure. Perhaps you could do the shopping. I’ ll be glad to help.,4,Or maybe make the beds.,0
8391,"May I help you? Yes, I’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department. I’ m Smith, the manager of Human Resources Department. May I ask your name? My name is Zhang Due.",0,Would you tell me what education background you have?,0
8392,"I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade. My major was International Trade. Do you have any experience in this field? Yes, I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years. OK. Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English?",0,Yes.,0
8393,"Welcome to our factory. I've been looking forward to visiting your factory. Actually, you'll know our products better after the visit. I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along. That'll be most helpful.",0,Maybe we could start with the Design Department. And then we could look at the production line.,0
8394,"Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes? No, Nancy, today I'm here to make a withdrawal. I made a formal request 7 days ago. You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit, right? That's correct. But before I do, I was wondering if you could give me some advice.",0,"Of course, Mr Hayes. That's what I'm here for. What would you like to know?",0
8395,"You would be using mainly English in this job. Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease? Yes, I think I speak English quite fluently. I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English. They say my English is quite good. How many years have you been learning English? Oh, more than ten years. I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher.",0,"Well, perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it.",0
8396,"Hi, I'm Benjamin. Nice to meet you here. You look great. Thank you. Nice to meet you too. I'm John. Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane? No, this is the second time. But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag. Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Take it easy. It will be OK soon. You see, I take this long-hour plane frequently, but the jet lag still makes me uneasy.",0,"Oh, that's too bad. Do you get a good knowledge of China?",0
8397,"Yes, whenever I think about China, I'd see the Tian'an Men Square. China is a very beautiful country. And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most. All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall. And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World. Was it built before the In dynasty? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty. No, before the In dynasty.",0,"Oh, yeah. Thought I am an American, I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well.",0
8398,"Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea. Yeah, many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China, I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them. Do you like the Chinese traditional silk? I heard about it, but I don't have any clothes made from silk.",0,Go and pick some stuff up. The price can always surprise foreign friends.,0
8399,"Hi. What can I get for you? I’ d like a half a pound of ground beef, please. Good choice! Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean. Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts?",0,"No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.",0

8402,I voted this morning. Who was your vote for President? I can’ t tell you that. Why can’ t you tell me?,0,That is private information.,0
8403,"Billy, you don’ t look too well. Maybe you should take the day off school. But Mom! Today we’ re playing football! I love football! You’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever. What’ s that on your arm? I don’ t know. It was there when I woke up this morning.",0,It’ s a rash. I’ d better take you to see the doctor. How did you get that bruise on your leg?,0
8404,"I bashed it against the chair in my room. Does it hurt? A little, but not much. Here. Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down. I’ ll take you to the doctor’ s after breakfast.",0,"If I’ m better this afternoon, can I go to school?",0
8405,"It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job. Susan, why do we need to find a job? We need to work is because we need money to live. We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house. We need money for many different things, and only when we work, we can earn money. And work can also help us feel that we are useful. But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now. Yes, it is really hard. But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally. When you work, you can accumulate a lot of experience. Besides, you need to learn a lot of things while you are working.",0,I've been fed up with study.,2
8406,"Excuse me? Can you do me a favor, please? It's my pleasure, what can I do for you? I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today. What brings you here?",0,I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation.,0
8407,"Where are you staying? I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel. Oh, it's not very far. And as far as I know it is a fancy place. Yes, it is. Do you know where I can get a town map?",0,"We sell them, right here.",0
8408,I called about that ad we saw in the paper. For the construction site manager? That's the one. What happened?,0,You were right. It was from a headhunter. She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract.,0
8409,"Well, no surprise there. No! Not at all. But, I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work. Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them? I'm going there tomorrow.",0,Great. Good luck.,4
8410,"Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer? Yes, and I think I have good news for you. Did they accept the counter-offer? Yes, they accepted your counter-offer, but they want you to pay for the home inspection.",0,How much will that cost?,0
8411,"It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection. Can I choose the home inspector? Yes, you are paying for it, so you get to choose. I would pick the best one. So, when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance?",0,I will call the owners right now. They will be happy to hear the good news.,4
8412,"This is our rock - bottom price, Mr. Li. We can't make any further concessions. If that's the case, there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off. What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great. I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price. How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded?",0,What is your proposal?,0
8413,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept. When I suggested we meet each other half way, I meant it literally. Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible. What would you suggest? The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars. That'll definitely be rock bottom.",0,"That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered. Let's meet each other half way once more, then the gap will be closed and our business completed.",0
8414,"You certainly have a way of talking me into it. All right, let's meet half way again. I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price. We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting. Yes, there's one other point I wish to clear up. What is it?",0,My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U. S. import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently.,0
8415,"Yes, they're right. In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade. I'm glad to hear that. With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties, and in particular, exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts, is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D. C.? Basically speaking, yes, we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D. C. Of course, there are more details to be attended to. We cannot settle it in a few words. Yes, of course. I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it. When do we meet again?",0,How about tomorrow morning at 9?,0
8416,What's wrong with you? I feel so tired. I really recommend you go for a run in the morning. Why? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day.,0,On the contrary! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day.,0
8417,"Welcome! Would you give me a bottle of beer, please? With ice, sir? No, ice will spoil the taste.",0,"Anything else, sir?",0
8418,"Hello, 35.. Is this Ann? Speaking. Ann, this is Sam. Look, Ann. I wanna see you again. How about a drink tonight?",0,I am sorry. I am very tired. I'm going to bed early.,5
8419,"How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles? In total, it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference. Would you like to see the breakdown? Yes, I want to know exactly where the money is going. Give me a detailed report. First we have the airline tickets, which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going, that's t $ 2,000. For our accommodations, we're spending $ 80 a night, per room, for five days. That's another $ 800.",0,"Weren’ t you able to find anything less expensive? We're sharing rooms, right?",0
8420,"I have two people to a room. The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find. With the conference going on that week, all the hotels have inflated their prices, they're making a killing. So far we have $ 2,800, what else? I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses. That totals another $ 800. And for other incidentals, like take fees, and tips, I have estimated about $ 400. Well, that's only $ 4000. Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000? Where is the rest of the money?",0,"That's my buffer... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget, just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry.",0
8421,"Good morning, room reservations. Can I help you? Yes, my name is Peter. I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st. I'd like to make some changes. The reservation should only be to June 20th. A single room from June 18th to 20th. Is that correct? Yes.",0,OK. Do you need a limousine service?,0
8422,"Gosh, another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes, It's no quicker than a bus. That's true. During rush hours, taxis are just as quick as buses. It was silly of me to have taken a taxi. At least, it can free you from the crowd. By the way, do you come from China?",0,"No, from New Zealand, sir. I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there.",0
8423,I have never done this before and don’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house. Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking you should offer? I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more. It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?,0,I hope that the owners aren’ t insulted by that offer.,0
8424,Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer. Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance? It usually doesn’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer. Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready?,0,The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified for your loan.,0
8425,"Is there a swimming pool in this hotel? We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim stations. What exactly does that mean? Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you swim.",0,That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?,0
8426,"If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations. Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym? To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7a. m. till 10. I'll go down there as soon as I can!",0,I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim stations.,0
8427,"So that will be one teddy, two terry cloth robes, three pairs of satin slippers, and two pairs of pajamas. Does all that come to 10,000 NT? Let me see... yes, 15,880 NT. After the discount, your total comes to 12,704 NT. Here's your free teddy bear, free panties and your card application. Where do I sign?",0,Right here. And write your address. You'll get the card in the mail within a week.,0
8428,"There's someone coming. It took them four minutes to get here. That was pretty fast. Yes, it's fast. But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage. I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning.",0,I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this. Do you know them well?,0
8429,"Not really. Do you know where they're vacationing? I think they went to Mexico, but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip, and they'll see half their house burned. Yes, but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home. Don't you think?",0,"Yes, I suppose. It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping.",0
8430,Can I help you? I'd like to buy a skirt. What style would you prefer? I like one with flowers on its brim.,0,Do you like this one?,0
8431,It seems too short. What about this one? It looks nice. How much is it? 70 yuan.,0,Is there any cheaper one?,0
8432,This one is only 50 yuan. I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now. It is better than this one although this one is cheaper. All right. Here is the money.,0,Thank you. Anything else?,4
8433,"Here is an invitation for you. Oh, thank you. What is the occasion? Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company. Our general manager invites you to a dinner party. Do you think you can manage it? Oh, yes, I'd very much like to go.",4,That is great. Dinner starts at 6,0
8434,your mp3 looks so cool. Where did you get it? I bought it online. really? Do you often shop online? yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.,0,I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?,0
8435,"yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home. sounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier. and you can still go "" window shopping "" just like in a real shopping mall. well, are there any other advantages?",0,"yes, most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",0
8436,I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much. I'm glad you appreciate our folk music. But a live performance is much more interesting. I can't wait anymore. When does the performance start? The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p. m.,0,( After the show ) It's an excellent musical. The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb.,0
8437,"Are you OK? I'm fine. I'm just so touched by the sad story. So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera. Which scene is your favorite? I love them all. But if I had to name one as the best, I would say it's the ending.",0,"What's it about? You know, I couldn't help falling asleep.",0
8438,"Did you? I didn't notice that. But still you should know it, for you have seen it with Laura before. I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her, too. I mean falling asleep. For me, this one is not that attractive. Then I doubt if you like operas at all. Yes. I like Carmen very much. But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one.",0,"OK, then. The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave, with a rose in his hand. When he got there, he saw someone already put a rose on her grave.",0
8439,"Very impressive. And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice. Me, too. There was always a good round of applause every time she sings. Yes, the applause! That was what kept waking me up during the show. And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting, and music. Just amazing!",4,"No doubt, it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show '.",4
8440,"What can I do for you, sir? What have you got this morning? Fruit juice, cakes and refreshments, and everything. I'd like to have a glass of tomato juice, please.",0,"Any cereal, sir?",0

8443,"First, I'll clean up the wound and then dress it. Must I stop all my training? Will I be able to attend the games? Take it easy. It's not serious. You should keep the wound very clean. Don't do strenuous exercises until your wound is healed.",0,"Thank you very much, doctor.",0
8444,Hi Sam. Hi Chris. I am glad to see you. Can you help me with my new computer? When did you buy your new computer? I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45.,0,So what's the problem?,0

8857,"Don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat. What are you talking about? We'll split the bill. No, I insist. I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't.

There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.",0,"Alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill.",0

Oh, there are so many French perfumers. Oops, perfumes for guys? So strange!",6,"Come on. Fashion is not only for women. Men also share the equal right to chase fashion.

8872,"Oh, really, that's really something new. I'm afraid not everyone can accept it. It takes time for that. But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly. That's true. Well, it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing. So, do you spend all your money on it? No. Fashion is just part of my life, which improves its quality. But also, I'm good at financing.

8877,"Certainly. After all, I've been here for two years. It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils. Though, I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table. Yes, table etiquette. There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told. Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners, while they are the norm in China. Hey, your chopsticks, old silly! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow!

What tips did your trainer give you? Mostly on how to exercise, but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits. Instead of eating 3 times a day, she told me to eat 5 times a day. That doesn't make sense. If you eat more, than how do you lose weight?",0,"Actually, I'm eating the same amount. I eat 5 smaller meals a day. Basically, it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate.",0

Here is the recommendation.",0
9035,"You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English. No problem. The professional English course is just English for Accounting.

Why did you choose to apply to our company? I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department. Her name is Lilling.

I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company.",0,Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees?,0

9049,"So, Monica, how do you like your new office? Well, I love it. The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine. There are plants along the corridor. Especially, I got my own desk with computer and telephone. Such a great place! That’ s very good. I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful. What was so bad about it?",0,"Small rooms, small window, a small desk shared by three people. I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work.",0
9050,"John, do you have a minute? Oh, hi, Leo. Sure, what’ s up? Well, I’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office. But I’ m not in there very often. It’ s so noisy that I can’ t work.",0,"That’ s exactly what I’ m getting at. We’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office, but have you noticed? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course. A lot people are going in and out.",0
9051,"Has anybody spoken to him about it? No, not yet, but someone’ s going to have to. We really can’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help, can we? No, of course not.

9052,"Ok, let’ s go through this one more time. I don’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses! I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine. Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing. So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?",0,"Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.",0
9053,Why am I being arrested? You have a warrant out for your arrest. I don't have a warrant. My computer shows that you have a bench warrant.,0,I don't know what a bench warrant is.,1

9055,"Alright, tell me what you think about this one. Don't you think it's a bit bright? Yeah, maybe you're right. How about this outfit? That dress looks lovely on you, but it's not very practical, is it?",0,"No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just want to try it on! What do you think about this? It's casual, yet sophisticated.",4
9056,"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It's too plain on its own. How about this scarf, these earrings, and an anklet? That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? That's a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.",4,"Thanks. You'd be OK on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",4

9064,"so, tell me about your new house. How is it different to your old one? well, first of all, it’ s much bigger. It has the same number of rooms, but each room is larger.

9067,"Can I help you with anything else? Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is? You'll find that by the paper towels. Oh, I didn't think of that.",0,That's where it'll be.,0
9068,"Excuse me, Mr. Li. I have something to discuss with you. I'm in a bit of a hurry, Miss Liu. Can you wait for a minute? I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now.

9206,"You won't believe what just happened. What? I went down to change some money, right? Yes. We need some. How much did you change?",0,I wanted to change around 5000 dollars. And you know the exchange rate.,0
9207,"Yes, it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar, right? Not today. What do you mean? I went into the bank with my money, and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it. I thought I was reading the board wrong or something.",0,Why?,6
9208,Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar. Sixty? That's too much. How can that be? I thought it was wrong too. It didn't make sense. Just two days ago it was 35.

9214,"even if I’ m only sick for one day? that’ s correct. that’ s pretty strict, if you ask me. well, we’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month, even though they weren’ t sick.",0,I see. I guess that makes sense.,0

9219,"Hmm... that’ s a bit out of my price range. Can you give me a better deal? This is an exclusive design by marco! It’ s a bargain at that price. Well, I don’ t know. I think I’ ll shop around. Okay, okay, how about one hundred dollars?",0,That’ s still more than I wanted to spend. What if I take both dresses?,0

9228,"Of course. We’ Ve got this style here that is very popular. Because it’ s an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year. They look great on everyone. Umm. too shiny. And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let’ s look for a closed-toe shoe. OK, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable. I don’ t like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. I don’ t want bows. I find slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally, this is what I’ m looking for.",0,What size?,0
9229,"What can I do for you? I'd like to have my hair cut. OK. This way, please. You look so busy.",0,We've particularly busy on Sunday. Please sit here. How do you wish it cut?,0

9239,"Now we have settled the terms of payment. Is it possible to effect shipment during September? I don't think we can. Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment? By the middle of October, I think.",0,"That's too late. You see, November is the season for this commodity in our market, and our Customs formalities are rather complicated.",0
9240,"I understand. Besides, the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks. Thus, after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers. The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season. But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter. In fact, many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter. Mr. Brown, you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us. If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices, we shall lose out.",0,"I see your point. However, we have done more business this year than any of the previous years. I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery.",0

Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn’ t have health insurance. This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn’ t look into a couple of different HMO’ s.",0,"Yeah, you’ re right. We aren’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older.",0
9245,"Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO’ s with low co-pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too. Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money. Well, we don’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions, so we should be fine. I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.",0,Not in a million years!,5
9246,Is everything all right? Not at all. What's the problem? Someone just robbed me.,4,What do you mean?,0

What will it be today?",0,"I've been wearing my hair long for years, but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style. What do you suggest for a woman like me, that is, with hair like mine?",0
9251,"Come here, please. We'd like to wash your hair first. That way it will be easier to cut and style. I think you'll like this style. It's very fashionable. I hope so.

9256,"I really wish I went to the game. It was the best game ever. So tell me the final score. The other team lost by three points, 101-98.",0,It must've been a close game.,0
9257,"The time has come to say goodbye. So soon. It seems as if you just got here. I feel that way, too. But all good things must come to an end, as they say. It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories.",4,I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights.,4

9263,"Yes, there are something good and informative. I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education. I agree. Are there any commercials on the TV? Of course. Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs. That makes a lot of sense. Does the TV work well?",0,Not always. It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals.,0

I really think we've bought this flat at the right time, you know. Market prices are going to go up, and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more.

9413,"That is the most boring, typical gift in the world! I know. But this year I want to get him an interesting tie. Like this one. That's not exactly a conversation piece. It's so plain. It's perfect! It's a Dilbert tie!",4,The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though...,0

9439,"Mr. Black, when is the earliest shipment you can make? In April or early May. I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us.

What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company? It's OK. You could send an email to the employer via the internet.",0,Good idea. It is convenient and fast.,0
9498,"You could inquire about the results directly, but should be politely. Certainly. I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly. If it's too long, I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it. I think that about one hundred words are enough.",0,"After you send the letter of inquiry, you should pay close attention not to miss any reply.",0
9499,"The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning, I feel really down. What’ s up? Well, actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday. Anything that distracts you from work?",0,"Yes, everything.

I know it’ s june now, but it will be perfect for autumn and winter.",0,"It looks too big for you, but I like the color and the material is good quality. Is it on sale?",4
9509,"Yes, it’ s half price. It’ s supposed to be too large-that’ s the fashion. I might get one too, but in a different colour. I prefer light blue to while. There. It looks great, don’ t you think?

9539,"Home at last. Tonight we have a lot of homework though. Are you saying we don’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight? Jane, you know I really don’ t like our teacher all that much. He gives far too much homework. He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time. To tell the truth, I don’ t really like him either. He’ s kind of boring and not very active.

9550,"Janice, do you still remember how our filing system works? Yes, I have read the Filling Instruction carefully, since you showed me it last week. Very good.

9807,"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It’ s even worse. ” Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people’ s appetite. I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way? The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right?",0,"Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits.",0
9808,"My name is James Owen. I’ m Manager of Sales. How do you do? How do you do? Thank you for coming. Did you have any trouble finding the office? Oh, no. It was easy.

9812,"Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV? Yes, I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl '. The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US, which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences. Yeah, and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind. Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society. That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes.",0,But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days. There's no such program on this year.,0
9813,"Yeah, these programs are gradually losing their appeal. No surprise. The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite. And they lack originality. Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol '. The same is true for ' My Hero '. Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince '.",0,I think producers are underestimating the audience. They should think of better ways to entertain the general public.,0

9825,"What do you think about all the different diets that people go on? I don't think dieting is good for you. It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with!

They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.",0,"So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate, don't you?",0
9826,"Sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert. How about drinking soda? Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever.

As you know, I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line.

As it is to our mutual interests and profit, I am sure you'll have no objection to it.",0
9867,"We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial. However, according to our records, the total amount of your order last year was moderate, which does not warrant an agency appointment. Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent. I'll come to that. My proposal is As far as I remember, we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone.

I know what you mean there. In many circumstances, people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake. And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet. Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines, like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine, alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself. We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere, improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship.

9898,"Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.",0,"Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.",0
9899,"All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level? That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.",0,"I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.",4
9900,"Hello. How can we be of service? I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan. OK, are you already an account holder? Yes, I am. But I'm not sure if I'm eligible.",0,"To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan, we will have to look at various aspects of your business, such as your long-term business prospects, your cash flow, your profitability, your capital structure...",0

9902,"Yes, I know. It’ s not the first time I’ m taking this! Don’ t worry, I won’ t overdose! Okay, anything else I can get you? Oh, yes, I almost forgot! Can I also get some eye drops and um, some condoms? Sure. Darn condoms aren’ t registered in our system.",0,"Oh, well that’ s okay, I’ ll get some later, thanks... Really it’ s no problem.",0
9903,"How much tea are you going to order? We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots. When do you want to deliver the goods? We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15.",0,"I'm sorry, but June 30 is quite soon. I can't guarantee 1 500 cases, I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases.",0
9904,"I can agree to that. Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases, to be delivered in 27 days, by June 30, and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15. Right? Right.

9908,"Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan. Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security? No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations. We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.",0,"Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York.

9912,"So what's the movie about? Well, it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for. But then she got reincarnated as a cat. Huh? I know. Stay with me. She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss. First, though, she had to discover her true cat nature. At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone, who was the real danger in the company. She had actually murdered the boss, who was her husband, and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder, so everyone thought Batwoman was evil.",0,I see. Batwoman married the boss?,0
9913,"No. Sharon Stone was married to the boss, who treated her badly, so she killed him. So where was I? OK, so then, at the same time she fell in love with a cop, who was investigating the murder of the boss. Finally, she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature. Wait a minute, I'm lost. The cop killed the boss? No, Sharon Stone did. And Sharon Stone is Batwoman?",0,Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying?,0

This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products, right? Can this line be right? It looks like our sales plummeted. I can't believe we did that poorly... If I remember correctly, sales went down slightly, but not as dramatically as the graph shows. I think you are looking at the wrong line. The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products. You are correct, the hair product sales decreased slightly, but not dramatically. The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products. I think there was a problem in the marketing plan. Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products, but it was already too late to mitigate the damage, so our mistake shows up in the sales. Well, the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off. Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks.",0,"That is our one major success.

What problems did you find?",0,"The roof leaks when it rains, there is mold on the bedroom walls, and the dishwasher doesn’ t work.",0
10513,"I don’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility. You can fix those things yourself. Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility.

10514,"Well, you know how important a clean house is to your grandma. Yes, I hear about it every time she comes here. She was the head janitor at St. Mary's Hospital for thirty years, after all.

10519,"Mary, besides the resume, I think we should also write an application letter. I think so, but how should we write it?

Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement.",0,"We should say we are very interested in that job, and we hope to get that job.",0
10520,"We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job. For example, I have mastered Business English very well, and I also know a little Spanish.

10522,"As I said, it is possible, but it would be much more expensive. I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system. That's too much. We need to use the separate units, I guess. It's more practical, and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them. So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars.",0,"Yes, that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent, of course.",0
10523,"You mean installation isn't included? I'm very surprised. No, Ma'am. Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units. In Taipei, you know, the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra. I know that, Ma'am. But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L. A., installation is charged separately.",0,"Yes, I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet.",0
10524,"I understand, Ma'am. And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars. It's a question of quality, Ma'am. At that price, you would not get good equipment. I've been in this business for almost twenty years. I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now, you will just have to replace the system after two years. I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars, installation included, I can accept.",0,Well.,0

10598,"Have you gotten a parking ticket before? No, I haven't. What about you? I got a ticket a couple of days ago. What did you do?",0,I got it for parking in the red zone.,0

They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether, though.",0,So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate?,0
10607,"Sure, they can eat some chocolate. As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods, there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert. How about drinking soda? Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda. Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever. If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda, try some diet coke. That's good advice. Have you ever tried taking vitamins?",0,"My mother used to make me take vitamins every day, but I don't take them anymore.

Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations? I think so. Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now?",0,"Of course. This balance sheet contains three major sections, that is, assets, liabilities and owner's equity. So, you see, the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372, 000, and the owner's equity is $ 5,400, 000. That means that the total assets, which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities, are $ 8,772, 000.",0
10692,Will you tell me the situation? I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so. And then? I came back to my room and found that my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone.,0,I'm afraid you must give up the cash.Are you insured?,0
10693,"Would you like anything else? No, I'm stuffed. The check, please. Here you are, sir. I hope you enjoyed your dinner. Yes, we did. Do I pay you or the cashier?",0,"Pay me, please.",0

10698,"You did? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered. Oh, the telephone lines were damaged by the storm. They repaired them yesterday. What did David do yesterday? Did he and Judy go dancing? No, they stayed home and played cards with the children.",0,"And what did you do? Did you play cards, too?",0
10699,"Were you at the scene during the robbery? Yes, I was, Officer. Were you able to see a lot? I was there as it happened.",0,What happened?,0
10700,The robber came in with a gun. Could you see his face? He had a mask over his face. Was he with someone else?,0,He was alone.,0
10701,"Alright, tell me what you think. Don't you think it’ s a bit bright? Yeah, maybe you’ re right. How about this outfit? This dress looks lovely on you, but it’ s not very practical, is it?",0,"No, I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon, but I love the way it looks. I just had to try it on! What do you think about this? It’ s casual, yet sophisticated.",0
10702,"I like the jeans, but you need something to go with the top. It’ s too plain on its own. How about this scarf, these earrings, AMD an anklet? That might be going overboard a bit. How about just that scarf with a bracelet? That’ s a good idea. You have a lot of good fashion sense.",4,"Thanks. You’ d be ok on your own. There are loads of fashion victims out there, and you are not one of them. Have you tried it on yet?",4
10703,"Yep. Here it is. What do you think? That looks great. Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans. Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them? The leopard print sounds fabulous. Are they a name brand? No, they’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing.",0,That’ s even better than the real thing.,4
10704,"I found it at a garage sale once. What a find! So, how much does it cost? Well, because I like you... ninety bucks. Ninety dollars is pretty steep. I'll take it for sixty bucks.",0,"Sixty bucks? No-can-do, son. You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five.",0
10705,"Oh, there is something wrong with my car. Your car is rather old. Why not change a new one? I want to change a new car. I like Honda best, especially the red one. But it is too expensive. Oh, there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon. I have two tickets. Would you like to go there with me?",0,Yeah. Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda.,0
10706,"Well, Mr. Cui, could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company? I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt. As you know, I majored in computer programming in the university. I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge. I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world, and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here. That’ s why I applied. I see. But have you ever done any work in this field? Yes, since 1993, I’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation.",0,Why do you plan to change your job?,0
10707,"Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement, and the job was not challenging enough. Have you applied for work with any other companies? Yes, I applied with another company, but that was just to get experience in being interviewed. If you are accepted at both places, which company will you choose?",0,"This one, of course. Your company is my first choice. I want to work for you.",0

Which course did you like best?,0
10711,"English. It was both interesting and useful, so I showed a great interest in it. Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student? Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it. I also performed well in the subjects. Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position. Did you get any honors and awards at college?",0,Yes. I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year. In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize.,0
10712,"Do you have any other questions? Yes, may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company? According to our regulations, you will be on probation for the first three months.

10718,"Did you go to school today? Of course. Did you? I didn't want to, so I didn't. That's sad, but have you gone to the movies recently?",0,That's a switch.,0
10719,"I'm serious, have you? No, I haven't. Why? I really want to go to the movies this weekend. So go then.",0,I really don't want to go by myself.,0
10720,I’ m moving out. Your lease isn’ t up yet. I won’ t be able to stay here anymore. That’ s going to be a problem.,0,I don’ t know why there’ s a problem.,6
10721,It’ s a problem because I can’ t give you your deposit back. Why can’ t you give it back to me? You’ re breaking our contract. I’ m going to need my deposit back.,0,That’ s not going to happen.,0

10723,"Yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home. Wounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier. And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall. Well, are there any other advantages?",0,"Yes, most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.",0
10724,"Come in, young man. ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei, nice to meet you, sir. I am Smith, the personnel director. Please have a seat, son. Thank you. Have you received my resume?",0,"Actually, I haven’ t had time to look it over. Did you bring another copy with you?",0

10726,"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it? I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life. You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art. An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating.",4,Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong?,0
10727,"I know he is a martial arts fiction writer. But I've read none of his novels. All of his works have been translated into English. I recommend you to read one or two works of his. You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture. When you go through the pages, you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone, but cover all walks of life. I see. They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements. Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life.",0,"So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation, isn't it?",0
10728,"Have you washed any clothes yet? No, I've only washed my whites. When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in? Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?",0,Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle.,0
10729,"How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash? There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash? It's really only a small load. Do you mind washing my clothes?",0,Not at all. It's no problem.,4
10730,"Excuse me, I'd like to try some Chinese food. We serve excellent Chinese food. Which style do you prefer? I know nothing about Chinese food. Could you give me some suggestions? It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food, Shandong food, Sichuan food etc.",0,Is there any difference?,0
10731,"Yes, Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy. How about Sichuan food? Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot. They taste differently. Oh, really. I like hot food. So what is your recommendation for me?",4,I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious. We have a Sichuan food dining room. May I suggest you to go there? It's on the third floor.,0
10732,"Good morning, madam. I think I'm lost here. The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton. Do you know in which area? No, I am sorry I have no idea. I am a stranger here. I see. Well, do you know anything near the hotel?",0,"Oh, yes. My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station.",0
10733,"Excuse me. Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is? Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks. Is it far from here? No, it’ s only ten-minute's walk.",0,Thanks a lot.,4
10734,"Ladies and gentlemen, now we are in the National Forest Park. What's that? The stone is a prehistoric log. It was turned to stone millions of years ago. Really? It's unbelievable.",6,But it's the truth.,0
10735,"Do you have Ginkgo trees here? We don't have them here, I'm afraid. Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather. What are these trees opposite to the pine trees? They are poplar trees. They are widely used in our lives.",0,I think I know that.,0
10736,"Steven, what's the expense of moving house? About 3 000 dollars. It costs a lot of money. Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings. Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses? I am afraid not, darling. Our expenses are mounting.",5,We have to cut back on our shopping from now on.,0
10737,"Mary, could you please come in for a short while? No problem. Mary, I'd like you to meet Richard, Our new executive in the marketing. Nice to meet you, Austin.",0,Welcome to our department. I hope you'll like it here.,0
10738,"By the way, Richard will assist me in the planning work. I hope you can work well together. Sure, if you've got any problem you can ask me. Thank you.It ' s very kind of you. Richard, Mary is a very helpful and experienced secretary indeed, and I'm sure you will find out.",4,"Thank you, sir. I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work.",4
10739,"Hi, Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you? Hello, Marsha. I'm great and you? Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute? Sure, what can I do for you?",0,We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid.,0
10740,"So this is a real thing? Right, this is not a drill. This is for all the marbles. When do you need it? ASAP, in writing of course.",0,"Sure, who am I bidding against?",0
10741,Do you plan on voting this Tuesday? Yes. What about you? I already voted. What do you mean you already voted?,6,I had to mail in an absentee ballot.,0
10742,Why’ d you have to do that? I’ m not going to be able to vote this Tuesday. Why is that? I have to work this Tuesday.,0,You can always go to work late.,0
10743,"Ah! It hurts. Don't touch it. What part hurts? The shoulder. Well, maybe you broke it. But what I'm worried about is this cut.",0,It's not a cut. It's a gash! It's bigger than a cut! Ah! I need a doctor.,0
10744,"C'mon. Just don't move. I'm bleeding too much. We don't have a decent First Aid Kit, do we? Yes. My bike has one under the seat. Get it, quick!",0,"There's some tape, iodine, and cloth bandages. I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding. What we need is a tourniquet.",0
10745,I’ m having a problem. What’ s the problem? A pipe burst in my wall. Is the pipe causing any water damage?,0,The water is causing mildew.,0
10746,I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow. Can I just call someone myself to fix it? I don’ t think that would be a good idea. You won’ t do it until tomorrow.,0,I guess you have a point.,0
10747,"Here! Here! Use my card! No, you don't! I should treat my new brother-in-law! Not on your life! I'm the best man, so I pay! OK, OK. On one condition.",0,What's that?,0
10748,Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in. Where else haven't I been to yet? Not many but these ones. They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls! Sounds great! How many kinds of folk collections they have?,0,"Well, there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city, that's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection, and several individual display rooms for private collections.",0
10749,"Private collectors! Oh, they must have excellent collections. I'll go and see each of them. What kinds of collections can I see? Come on, David, don't keep me in suspense! No hurry! I'll tell you now. The collections include ancient cases and caskets, tea sets, abacuses, precious sea shells and conches, jars and water abacuses for study use, drama costumes, agates, ancient coins, butterflies, fans, mini musical instruments, root-carving, rare stones and rocks, model ships, model cars. Enough, David! I can't wait anymore. Let's go right now! Okey, Okey. We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House, a multi-folk collection exhibition hall, where the best of local antique objects are on constant display. The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty, a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself. Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there.",0,Very interesting. That's really a place I must go and see. And then?,0
10750,"John, why don’ t you go and do some gardening? The lawn needs weeding. Because I’ m not in the mood, that’ s why. Well, don’ t just sit there, do something. Come and help me in the kitchen. Help you in the kitchen, I don’ t feel like it.",0,Would you like to clear the table then?,0
10751,"Really? Do I have to do it? Not, if you don’ t want to. Well, isn’ t there anything you want? Yes, I want to go out. Would you like to come?",0,"No, why should I? I don’ t feel like it. Besides, I’ m in such a bad mood.",0

10755,"I'd like to purchase a pan. Is there any particular size that you want? Well, I cook a lot of big meals. What do you think of this one? It's a 16 ” pan.",0,"Yes, that's the right size, but it's so heavy.",0
10756,"Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter. Yes, this is very light. But the handle is also aluminum. No problem. Look at this one. Same pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle. Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it.",4,I think you'll love this pan. Do you want to pay with cash?,4

10760,I heard you are looking for a house. Yes. How is this going? I haven’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet.,0,I can recommend an apartment for you. A friend of mine is about to move. She doesn’ t want to rent that house any longer.,0

10763,"This is a very spacious apartment. It's forty pings, including the parking space. That's about one thousand four hundred square feet. Wow. It's just the two of us.

10771,"During the last two years, there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad. If they steal the entire package, that would be theft. So they don't do that. Generally, thieves open the case and take part of the contents out. Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same. If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition, the steamship company doesn’ t have liability for pilferage. How do we protect ourselves? The insurance policy protects us.",0,"Is it true that products of high value such as watches, jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage?",0

10778,"That wardrobe looks quite big. Is it full of clothes? Yes. I have some many clothes stuffed into it. Perhaps I should get rid of some of them. There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore. I like to get rid of clothes that I don’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe. They take up too much space. There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to. They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition. That’ s a good idea. After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear, I can see what new clothes I need to buy.",4,I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too. Perhaps we can go together one day.,0

I am not impressed by the interior of this house. Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint.",0,"With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are?",0
10794,I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and spacious. Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space?

10799,"Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often? First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’ t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves. I see. What else? We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.",0,"Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’ t seem like a waste of time and money.",0

10807,"Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’ s get started! Let’ s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color. Now that our bread is ready, let’ s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person’ s palate is different, but I’ m going to give you a few tips that you’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich. Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can’ t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.",4,"Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!",4

10812,"Excuse me. Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo? Well, you can take the No. 36 bus from here, but then you have to walk about 30 minutes. That doesn't sound too bad.

Does that look like hail to you? it does, actually. Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping.",0,that's a good idea. But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it.,0
10829,ok. I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on. It's a bit chilly in here. how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last? I don't know.

Okay, the bathroom plumbing needs looking at. What about the kitchen plumbing?",0,Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well.,0
10979,Has this problem been going on for a long time? It just started happening last night. I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon. Will you be there? I will not be home.,0,"I can always use my key to get in, but I would prefer that you be there.",0
10980,"I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews. You have found your way to the interview class. Please come in!

10981,"Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important. Yes, and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview. The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company. What else should I be thinking about?",0,Be yourself and be honest. Simply answer the questions put to you.,0

10984,"My name is Sue. How do you do, Mr. Black? I'm glad to meet you, Sue. Please have a seat. Thank you, sir. We've looked over your letter and resume and I'm very satisfied with them. Today I want to invite you talk about insurance you're interested in.",0,Thank you. I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance.,0
10985,"I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito. I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you. I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today. I really don't have enough money.",0,My stomach feels so empty.,0
10986,"Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too. I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then. Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat. That's not nice.",0,You can always go home and make something to eat.,0

Oh, just one thing, could you give me some ideas of the pay?",0,What salary do you get for your present position?,0
10992,"2,000 RIB per month. What starting salary would you expect here? 3,000 RIB per month. No problem, we pay 3,000 RIB per month. Plus a 20 % commission on all, a company car and other benefits.

I'm usually out in the daytime.",0,All right. Good-bye.,0
10998,"Would you like to order anything else? No, I'm good. All we need now is our check. Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she? I think that is our waitress is over by the bar. Boy, the service has not been good this evening.",0,"She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.",0
10999,Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together. Our total for dinner is $ 36.00. What do you think would be the right amount to tip? I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.,0,"I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.",0
11000,"Are you okay, man? You don’ t look very well. Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor, and things got a little out of hand. Nice! So, where did you guys go? We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!",0,Oh no! Mike’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure!,6

11003,"Hello baseball fans, and welcome back to today’ s game! My name is Rick Fields and of course, I am here, once again, with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland. ' It’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions. Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game. It’ s time to play ball! Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and strike one!",4,"A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive!",4
11004,"Alan, I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list. Are you interested in some of our products? Yes, I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts, but I find your price is on the high side. I'm very surprised to hear you say that. I think our price is very favorable. You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers. I'm not so sure of that. I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price.",0,What's your proposal then?,0
11005,"I think to get the business done, you should at least reduce the price by 20 %. We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one, but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do. What quantity are you going to order from us then? As a trial order, I'll take 5,000 dozen this time. 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order. In that case, the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction.",0,That's really a big change from 20 %. I really can't accept that.,0
11006,"What's your counter-offer then? To conclude the deal, I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help. 15 % is impossible. That'll leave us almost no profit. If that's the case, I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs.",0,"How about doing it this way? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction.",0
11007,How’ s it going? I’ m great. Thanks. What do you need? I need to know if I have any fees to pay.,0,"Actually, you do owe some fees.",0

11016,"What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business? Well, there are several things. Of course, you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high. So, do you think workers should be paid as little as possible? No. if you do that, the workers won’ t like their jobs. They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover. Those things will increase you costs.",0,How can a business maximise revenues?,0
11017,Excuse me. Yes? How can I help you? Are these drinks on sale this weekend? Yes.,0,Can I buy more than one case?,0

11022,That’ s lucky. Why is that? You turned 18 in an election year. I didn’ t think about it like that.,0,Really?,6
11023,"Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms. I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents. I fully understand your position. An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time. But, on the other hand it would add to the buying costs. We've been, after all, trading partners for 3 years and you know us well. Can't you give us D / A or D / P? I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C.",0,"But on our part, our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports. And there is the licensing problem.",0
11024,"Can I get some medicine to help me? For your high blood pressure, we have several choices of medications. What types of drugs can I try? Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention.",0,What about side effects from that medication?,0
11025,"Most people have no side effects. You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication. Do I only need to take that one drug? I am going to add a second drug for now, Lisinopril, which is an ACE inhibitor. What can I expect when I take that medication?",0,You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough.,0
11026,"Look at the catalogue, John. I think I want to get this red blouse Don't you have one like this in blue? Yah, but it doesn't have a red one. Do you need every color in the rainbow?",0,Yes!,0

11029,"Believe me, it's worth the price. It's more than I can afford. Can I make an offer? How much are you willing to pay? Shall we make it 250 dollars?",0,No. That price would hardly cover the cost.,5
11030,"What are you doing to your house? We're redecorating our living room. What are you going to do to it? First, we're going to change the curtains, then we're going to paint the walls.",0,What colour are you going to paint them?,0

11033,It goes all the way there. Do you know what street it goes on? Catch it on Altadena Drive. I would've never known.,0,Now you know.,0
11034,"Honey, we are all out of wine and cheese. Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things? Can’ t it wait? I’ m watching the game right now! Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things. Fine! What do you need?",0,"OK, pick up some cured meats to go with the wine. Maybe a pound of polish sausages, ham, liverwurst, salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale. I think I saw a promotion for pastrami. Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives.",0

11040,"Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem? I don’ t know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is? Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Mmmm, it doesn’ t look good. What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It’ s brand new!",6,"Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission.

In fact, we haven't had any so far this winter. The winter is rather long, but the cold is generally not severe. The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade.",0

About freezing point, I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero.

11059,"Are you on the up and up? Definitely. you know, I'm into serious sport in a big way. If you asked me, you've got a screw loose somewhere. come off it, It's not that serious. You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime.",0,"Fat chance, I'm too scared of bungee jumping.",0
11060,"No, really, I think you'd like it. I adapted to it right off the bat. What did that have to do with me? I'm not the self-seeker like you. I can teach you how.

11063,"How often are stockholders meetings held? Stockholders meetings are held biannually. Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall. In between the meetings, each stockholder receives biannual reports. Financial statements are made once a year. What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings? I'm guessing not a large percentage... You're right, it's a low percentage. Also, in order to attend meetings, you have to hold a certain amount of shares. It's quite a large number, so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings.",0,"So, how much say do the stockholders really have?",0
11064,"May I take your order now? Yes, bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak. Do you want some salad dressing? Yes, what kind do you have?",0,"We have Italian, French, thousand island and blue cheese.",0

11066,"Mr. Jones, shall we now discuss the packaging? Very well. You know, we have definite ways of packaging garments. As to blouses, we use a polythene wrapper for each article, all ready for window display. Good. A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales. With competition from similar garments producers, the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive. Right you are. We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse.",0,What about the outer packing?,0
11067,"We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton, gross weight around 25 kilos a carton. Cartons? Yes, corrugated cardboard boxes. Could you use wooden cases instead?",0,Why use wooden cases?,0
11068,"I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load. The cartons are comparatively light, and therefore easy to handle. They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo. The stevedores will see to that. Besides, we'll reinforce the cartons with straps. Silk blouses are not fragile goods. They can stand a lot of jolting. Maybe you are right, but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London. If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf, the dampness or rain may get into them. This would make the blouses spotted or ruined. No need to worry about that. The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof, and as the boxes are made of cardboard, they will be handled with care.",0,"Well, I don't want to take any chances. Besides, cartons are easy to cut open, and this increases the risk of pilferage.",0
11069,"Tampering with cartons is easily detected. I should say that this rather discourages pilferage.

11596,"Good, any other clues? I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away. I waited for the traffic light for a very long time.

We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle. Hong Kong is out of the question.",0,"It's like this.
